The usual explanation is “it’s written in Rust.” That’s true, but it doesn’t explain much. Plenty of tools are written in Rust without being notably fast. The interesting question is what design decisions made the difference.</p> <p>Charlie Marsh’s <a href=\"https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/uv-an-extremely-fast-python-package-manager/\">Jane Street talk</a> and a <a href=\"https://xebia.com/blog/uv-the-engineering-secrets-behind-pythons-speed-king/\">Xebia engineering deep-dive</a> cover the technical details well. The interesting parts are the design decisions: standards that enable fast paths, things uv drops that pip supports, and optimizations that don’t require Rust at all.</p> <h2 id=\"the-standards-that-made-uv-possible\">The standards that made uv possible</h2> <p>pip’s slowness isn’t a failure of implementation. For years, Python packaging required executing code to find out what a package needed.</p> <p>The problem was <a href=\"https://setuptools.pypa.io/\">setup.py</a>. You couldn’t know a package’s dependencies without running its setup script. But you couldn’t run its setup script without installing its build dependencies. <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/\">PEP 518</a> in 2016 called this out explicitly: “You can’t execute a setup.py file without knowing its dependencies, but currently there is no standard way to know what those dependencies are in an automated fashion without executing the setup.py file.”</p> <p>This chicken-and-egg problem forced pip to download packages, execute untrusted code, fail, install missing build tools, and try again. Every install was potentially a cascade of subprocess spawns and arbitrary code execution. Installing a source distribution was essentially <code>curl | bash</code> with extra steps.</p> <p>The fix came in stages:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/\">PEP 518</a> (2016) created pyproject.toml, giving packages a place to declare build dependencies without code execution. The TOML format was borrowed from Rust’s Cargo, which makes a Rust tool returning to fix Python packaging feel less like coincidence.</li> <li><a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/\">PEP 517</a> (2017) separated build frontends from backends, so pip didn’t need to understand setuptools internals.</li> <li><a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/\">PEP 621</a> (2020) standardized the <code>[project]</code> table, so dependencies could be read by parsing TOML rather than running Python.</li> <li><a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0658/\">PEP 658</a> (2022) put package metadata directly in the Simple Repository API, so resolvers could fetch dependency information without downloading wheels at all.</li> </ul> <p>PEP 658 went live on PyPI in May 2023. uv launched in February 2024. uv could be fast because the ecosystem finally had the infrastructure to support it. A tool like uv couldn’t have shipped in 2020. The standards weren’t there yet.</p> <p>Other ecosystems figured this out earlier. Cargo has had static metadata from the start. npm’s package.json is declarative. Python’s packaging standards finally bring it to parity.</p> <h2 id=\"what-uv-drops\">What uv drops</h2> <p>Speed comes from elimination. Every code path you don’t have is a code path you don’t wait for.</p> <p>uv’s <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/\">compatibility documentation</a> is a list of things it doesn’t do:</p> <p><strong>No .egg support.</strong> Eggs were the pre-wheel binary format. pip still handles them; uv doesn’t even try. The format has been obsolete for over a decade.</p> <p><strong>No pip.conf.</strong> uv ignores pip’s configuration files entirely. No parsing, no environment variable lookups, no inheritance from system-wide and per-user locations.</p> <p><strong>No bytecode compilation by default.</strong> pip compiles .py files to .pyc during installation. uv skips this step, shaving time off every install. You can opt in if you want it.</p> <p><strong>Virtual environments required.</strong> pip lets you install into system Python by default. uv inverts this, refusing to touch system Python without explicit flags. This removes a whole category of permission checks and safety code.</p> <p><strong>Stricter spec enforcement.</strong> pip accepts malformed packages that technically violate packaging specs. uv rejects them. Less tolerance means less fallback logic.</p> <p><strong>Ignoring requires-python upper bounds.</strong> When a package says it requires <code>python&lt;4.0</code>, uv ignores the upper bound and only checks the lower. This reduces resolver backtracking dramatically since upper bounds are almost always wrong. Packages declare <code>python&lt;4.0</code> because they haven’t tested on Python 4, not because they’ll actually break. The constraint is defensive, not predictive.</p> <p><strong>First-index wins by default.</strong> When multiple package indexes are configured, pip checks all of them. uv picks from the first index that has the package, stopping there. This prevents dependency confusion attacks and avoids extra network requests.</p> <p>Each of these is a code path pip has to execute and uv doesn’t.</p> <h2 id=\"optimizations-that-dont-need-rust\">Optimizations that don’t need Rust</h2> <p>Some of uv’s speed comes from Rust. But not as much as you’d think. Several key optimizations could be implemented in pip today:</p> <p><strong>HTTP range requests for metadata.</strong> <a href=\"https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/\">Wheel files</a> are zip archives, and zip archives put their file listing at the end. uv tries PEP 658 metadata first, falls back to HTTP range requests for the zip central directory, then full wheel download, then building from source. Each step is slower and riskier. The design makes the fast path cover 99% of cases. None of this requires Rust.</p> <p><strong>Parallel downloads.</strong> pip downloads packages one at a time. uv downloads many at once. Any language can do this.</p> <p><strong>Global cache with hardlinks.</strong> pip copies packages into each virtual environment. uv keeps one copy globally and uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link\">hardlinks</a> (or copy-on-write on filesystems that support it). Installing the same package into ten venvs takes the same disk space as one. Any language with filesystem access can do this.</p> <p><strong>Python-free resolution.</strong> pip needs Python running to do anything, and invokes build backends as subprocesses to get metadata from legacy packages. uv parses TOML and wheel metadata natively, only spawning Python when it hits a setup.py-only package that has no other option.</p> <p><strong>PubGrub resolver.</strong> uv uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/blob/master/doc/solver.md\">PubGrub algorithm</a>, originally from Dart’s pub package manager. pip uses a backtracking resolver. PubGrub is faster at finding solutions and better at explaining failures. pip could adopt PubGrub without rewriting in Rust.</p> <h2 id=\"where-rust-actually-matters\">Where Rust actually matters</h2> <p>Some optimizations do require Rust:</p> <p><strong>Zero-copy deserialization.</strong> uv uses <a href=\"https://rkyv.org/\">rkyv</a> to deserialize cached data without copying it. The data format is the in-memory format. This is a Rust-specific technique.</p> <p><strong>Lock-free concurrent data structures.</strong> Rust’s ownership model makes concurrent access safe without locks. Python’s GIL makes this difficult.</p> <p><strong>No interpreter startup.</strong> Every time pip spawns a subprocess, it pays Python’s startup cost. uv is a single static binary with no runtime to initialize.</p> <p><strong>Compact version representation.</strong> uv packs versions into u64 integers where possible, making comparison and hashing fast. Over 90% of versions fit in one u64. This is micro-optimization that compounds across millions of comparisons.</p> <p>These are real advantages. But they’re smaller than the architectural wins from dropping legacy support and exploiting modern standards.</p> <h2 id=\"design-over-language\">Design over language</h2> <p>uv is fast because of what it doesn’t do, not because of what language it’s written in. The standards work of PEP 518, 517, 621, and 658 made fast package management possible. Dropping eggs, pip.conf, and permissive parsing made it achievable. Rust makes it a bit faster still.</p> <p>pip could implement parallel downloads, global caching, and metadata-only resolution tomorrow. It doesn’t, largely because backwards compatibility with fifteen years of edge cases takes precedence. But it means pip will always be slower than a tool that starts fresh with modern assumptions.</p> <p>Other package managers could learn from this: static metadata, no code execution to discover dependencies, and the ability to resolve everything upfront before downloading. Cargo and npm have operated this way for years. If your ecosystem requires running arbitrary code to find out what a package needs, you’ve already lost.</p> </div>"},{"id":"https://devblog.qnx.com/qnx-self-hosted-developer-desktop-initial-release/","title":"QNX Self-Hosted Developer Desktop","link":"https://devblog.qnx.com/qnx-self-hosted-developer-desktop-initial-release/","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46398201","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46398201\">Comments</a>","date":1766798213000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<section> <p>The team and I are beyond excited to share what we've been cooking up over the last little while: <strong>a full desktop environment running on QNX 8.0, with support for self-hosted compilation</strong>!

Austin Freeman - <em>This is the first book that I’ve read from Freeman and I suspect that I will read many more in the future. The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham, Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation stalls, the eminent Dr.&nbsp;Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it. The book is one of the best whodunits that I’ve ever read.</em></li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/564\">The Mystery of Edwin Drood</a></strong> by Charles Dickens - <em>His final work remains unfinished as he passed away before he could complete it. Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints, accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself. What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the “Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000CHQCS/?tag=fogus-20\">Chiltern Library edition</a> of the book contains the story and a good bit of the lore around the writing and the meta-works available at the time of its publication.<a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>4</sup></a></em></li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shadow-people-Margaret-St-Clair/dp/B00005XVNT/?tag=fogus-20\">The Shadow People</a></strong> by Margaret St.&nbsp;Clair - <em>Sadly out of print and difficult to find, but I’ve had it on my shelves for decades and finally got around to reading it. The book came onto my radar in the 1980s when I learned about it in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_N\">appendix-n</a> of the 1st edition Advanced D&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide. I enjoyed many of the books at the time and have slowly swung around to re-reading them over the past few years. Sadly, most on the list do not stand the test of time for me, but St.&nbsp;Clair’s mixture of 60s counter-cultural leanings in a fantasy/sf world still works. The cultural touch-points in the book feel quite dated, but despite the occasional awkwardness, the story is unique even today.</em></li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/lolly-willowes-warbler-classics-annotated-edition-sylvia-townsend-warner/793f95da3bb968a0?aid=98208&amp;ean=9781959891635&amp;listref=best-things-2025&amp;next=t\">Lolly Willowes</a></strong> by Sylvia Townsend Warner - <em>The book started as a passable novel of manners focused on a turn of the century British middle-class family. The titular character was mostly background decoration for the first third of the novel and AFAIR was talked about only in the third-person. It’s only when she made the choice to move out on her own to the country<a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>5</sup></a> in her middle age does she gain a central role in the narrative and her inner thoughts revealed. This is where things really pick up because I was shocked to learn that this unassuming woman’s inner thoughts had a delicious darkness to them. I don’t want to give away too much, but I’ll just say that you will not expect how the story ends.</em></li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.fantagraphics.com/collections/daniel-clowes/products/patience\">Patience</a></strong> by Daniel Clowes - <em>A profound graphic novel using time-travel to explore the idea of enduring love with a story that proceed through time, following Jack as he tries to alter the past and save the woman he loves.

Starting early in the year I knew that I needed a better way to track my tasks. So to start the year I visited a couple of Japanese stationary stores<a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>15</sup></a> to get some ideas. In 2024 I had used the Hobonichi Techo<a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>16</sup></a> and while I found it to be a lovely system, it didn’t quite work for me. First, it wasn’t clear how or if I was making progress on my tasks without spelunking into the past pages of the schedule. Second, I take a lot of notes longhand in cheap composition notebooks and so I found myself jumping back and forth between those and the Hobonichi. I tried using an insert into my Techo case for note-taking but I didn’t like the form-factor. I take big sprawling notes and filled the pages too quickly. So after the new year I took a minimalist approach with a Japanese calendar stamp:</p> <figure> <img src=\"https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/images/bts25-stamp-cal.jpg\" alt=\"Rubber stamp calendar\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"> </figure> <p>The image above shows an example, but the problem with it should be apparent… there’s just not enough room for fidelity. OK, sure it didn’t work as a real task tracker, but I still use it to keep track of small bits of detail associated with days of the week like: energy level, mood, sleep, exercise, etc. It became apparent that I needed something that solved three problems: 1) track any number of tasks, 2) give me an idea of my progress at a glance, and 3) be on hand already. My first pass at this was to draw a 4-week grid on my notebook and scribble tasks in pencil into the cells. I would then color the grid as I progressed through tasks. This worked great for about 5 weeks until I went on a week-long trip without my notebook, killing my solution to #3. Even before that however I had found that I wanted to make frequent changes and move things around, defer items, and change the colors, so it became apparent that I had another problem to solve; 4) allow for easy change. While I was on my week-long trip I decided to find a solution that account for all four of my problems, and it turned out that my solution was the solution to so many other problems… spreadsheets!</p> <figure> <img src=\"https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/images/bts25-tasks-sheet.jpg\" alt=\"My ongoing tasks sheet\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"> </figure> <p>Above you’ll see a representational image that gives the basics of the task tracking. The rows correspond to tasks and the columns to the months. The white section on the left are the tasks details like category, name, description, and success criteria. The colored segments represent the state of the tasks regarding progress. The left-most colored column is the current month. Each cell is filled in before the month starts with high-level goals which are amended and modified as I make progress (or not). The meaning of the colors are:</p> <ul> <li>Light green: Task completed and success criteria met</li> <li>Dark green: Task completed, but its success criteria changed during the process</li> <li>Light orange: Not started</li> <li>Dark orange: In progress (not shown above)</li> <li>Red: Incomplete and/or unsuccessful</li> <li>Gray: Not applicable. This is for new tasks that are added to the tracker, or removed and brought back. All months are back-filled in gray.</li> </ul> <p>And that’s the whole system. It’s easy to change and rearrange. It’s on-hand.<a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>17</sup></a> I can see how I’m doing at a glance. Can track any number of simultaneous tasks.

I tried in earnest to make AI work for me, with varying degrees of un-success. I’ve had zero success leveraging it in my work maintaining and evolving Clojure. For problem formation in the face of novelty, LLMs have been more frustrating than helpful and the little gains that I’ve found were in the very early phases of problem solving requiring a bare minimum of experimental code. But even these examples operate wholly in the known rather than in the unknown where I’d like to operate instead. Even in these early stages the “hand-holding” involved was more frustrating than helpful. In my work, the bottleneck is absolutely not the code. While I think that the kind of up-front work that I do could inform prompt-engineering to some degree, by the time that I get to that point the code is often perfunctory. Most of the work that I do is devising and investigating new problem framing rather than in interpolation of the known (i.e.&nbsp;analogy play). While the latter is important for sure, what’s known often acts as a source of tension to help motivate and tease out potentially new solutions. And this is a huge problem in the very nature of LLMs. That is, they are trained on the products of problem solving processes rather then also in the very processes themselves. Further, as a Socratic partner, LLMs are incredibly frustrating in their inability to move a “discussion” forward. A good Socratic partner creates pressure to move toward truth, but LLMs are too sycophantic, lack an awareness of useful tension,<a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>20</sup></a> cannot often identify contradiction, and lack any ability to adhere to the trajectory of a conversation.

While a larger proportion of scientific and computing information is available in digitized form, there are still whole fields of knowledge left on paper, so to speak. First, a large problem with this fact is that only a small fraction of total knowledge is available to training LLMs, leaving large gaps in the knowledge base exacerbating the problem of decoupled confidence and reality. Second, this is problematic because training these models on digital-data leads to an amplification of the biases inherent in the digitized records. This can be mitigated by the search-augmented and human-in-the-loop systems, but these are also incomplete sources of validation and even the validation itself has bias (e.g.&nbsp;SEO, status quo, liability constraints, etc.) and often reduce the traceability of an answer. A second informational downside of LLMs is that they take training data at face-value rather than inherent value. However, in my programming career I’ve learned a lot more from bad code than good code. Likewise, code input to training is heavily biased to work at all and the ingestion itself it geared strictly to work to build a plausible-continuation model. Good code works as exemplars of clarity, layering abstractions, maintainability, and sad-path security, but so does bad code. Heavily curated or contrasting training data could mitigate this to some degree, but at the moment, a lot of the code generated by LLMs is often lacking these fundamental code characteristics. This matches my actual observation of code generation, but I would imagine that the inability of the ingestion to distinguish valid examples from cautionary examples is more general problem. These are all technical points and do not take into account the societal problems that LLMs present… which are bountiful! These are evolving critiques that I’ll refine through more exposure.<a href=\"#fnref21\" role=\"doc-backlink\">↩︎</a></p></li> <li id=\"fn22\"><p>The Boox is a truly lovely device, but I’ve developed a diametric motivation to de-device myself.

Anyway, despite their trivial implementation they can be extremely useful.

During training, each step consists of the following:</p><div><ol><li>Randomly select a training sample.</li><li>Compare this training sample against all nodes in the SOM. The node with the smallest (quantization) error becomes the BMU (best matching unit).</li><li>Update the SOM node weights proportional to how far away from the BMU they are. Nodes closer to the BMU become more like the training sample.</li></ol></div><p>There are numerous modifications that can be made, but that’s basically it! If I’ve piqued your interest, I highly recommend the book <i><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/838949.Self_Organizing_Maps\">Self-Organizing Maps</a></i> by Teuvo Kohonen, it’s a fairly quick read and covers the core aspects of SOMs.</p><p>With dimensionality reduction and assignment resolved, we just need the visual embeddings now. I started with the brand new <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10104\">DinoV3</a> model, but was left rather disappointed. The progression of Meta’s self-supervised vision transformers has been truly incredible, but the latent space captures waaay more information than what I actually need. I just want to encode the high level aesthetic details of webpage screenshots. Because of this, I fell back on an old friend: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplet_loss\">triplet loss</a> on top of a small encoder. The resulting output dimension of 64 afforded ample room for describing the visual range while maintaining a considerably smaller footprint.</p><p>This got me 90% of the way there, but it was still lacking the visual layout I had envisioned. I wanted a stronger correlation with color at the expense of visual similarity. To achieve this, I had to manually enforce this bias by training two SOMs in parallel. One SOM operated on the encoder output (visual), the second SOM on the color distribution and were linked using the following:</p><p><img src=\"https://nry.me/posts/2025-10-09/small-web-screenshots/imgs/mapping.svg\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p><p>When the quantization error is low, the BMU pulling force is dominated by the visual similarity. As quantization error increases, the pulling force due to visual similarity wanes and is slowly overpowered by the pulling force from the color distribution. In essence, the color distribution controls the macro placement while the visual similarity controls the micro placement. The only controllable hyperparameter with this approach is selecting a threshold for where the crossover point occurs.</p><p>I didn’t spend much time trying to find the optimal point, it’s currently peak fall and well, I’d much rather be outside. A quick look at the overall quantization error (below left) and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-matrix\">U-matrix</a> (below right) was sufficient.</p><p><img src=\"https://nry.me/posts/2025-10-09/small-web-screenshots/imgs/qe_error.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"> <img src=\"https://nry.me/posts/2025-10-09/small-web-screenshots/imgs/u_matrix.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p><p>There’s still a lot of cruft that slipped in (substack, medium.com, linkedin, etc…) but overall, I’d say it’s not too bad for a first pass.

Each element is replaced by the determinant of the 2×2 matrix formed by that element and its neighbors to the south, east, and southeast. The bottom row and rightmost column have no such neighbors and are removed. There is one additional part of the algorithm that will be easier to describe after introducing some notation.</p> <h2>Details</h2> <p>Let <em>A</em> be the matrix whose determinant we want to compute and let <em>A</em><sup>(<em>k</em>)</sup> be the matrix obtained after <em>k</em> steps of the condensation algorithm.</p> <p>The matrix <em>A</em><sup>(1)</sup> is computed as described in the overview:</p> <p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.johndcook.com/dodgson1.svg\" alt=\"a^{(1)}_{ij} = a_{ij} a_{i+1, j+1} - a_{i, j+1} a_{i+1, j}.\" width=\"227\" height=\"25\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p> <p>Starting with <em>A</em><sup>(2)</sup> the terms are similar, except each 2×2 determinant is divided by an element from two steps back:</p> <p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.johndcook.com/dodgson2.svg\" alt=\"a^{(k+1)}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{a^{(k-1)}_{i+1,j+1}}\\left(a^{(k)}_{ij} a^{(k)}_{i+1, j+1} - a^{(k)}_{i, j+1} a^{(k)}_{i+1, j} \\right)\" width=\"334\" height=\"47\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37354/37354-pdf.pdf\">Dodgson’s original paper</a> from 1867 is quite readable, surprisingly so given that math notation and terminology changes over time.</p> <p>One criticism I have of the paper is that it is hard to understand which element should be in the denominator, whether the subscripts should be <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> or <em>i</em>+1 and <em>j</em>+1. His first example doesn’t clarify this because these elements happen to be equal in the example.</p> <h2>Example</h2> <p>Here’s an example using condensation to find the determinant of a 4×4 matrix.</p> <p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.johndcook.com/dodgson4.svg\" alt=\"\\begin{align*} A^{(0)} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 \\\\ 5 &amp; 9 &amp; 2 &amp; 6 \\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ A^{(1)} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} 22 &amp;-34 &amp; 22 \\\\ 35 &amp; -5 &amp;-6 \\\\ -14 &amp; 14 &amp; 3 \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ A^{(2)} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} 120 &amp; 157 \\\\ 60 &amp; 69 \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ A^{(3)} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} 228 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align*}\" width=\"188\" height=\"236\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p> <p>We can verify this with Mathematica:</p> <pre> Det[{{3, 1, 4, 1}, {5, 9, 2, 6}, {0, 7, 1, 0}, {2, 0, 2, 3}}] </pre> <p>which also produces 228.</p> <h2>Division</h2> <p>The algorithm above involves a division and so we should avoid dividing by zero. Dodgson says to</p> <blockquote><p>Arrange the given block, if necessary, so that no ciphers [zeros] occur in its interior. This may be done either by transposing rows or columns, or by adding to certain rows the several terms of other rows multiplied by certain multipliers.</p></blockquote> <p>He expands on this remark and gives examples. I’m not sure whether this preparation is necessary only to avoid division by zero, but it does avoid the problem of dividing by a zero.</p> <p>If the original matrix has all integer entries, then the division in Dodgson’s condensation algorithm is exact. The sequence of matrices produced by the algorithm will all have integer entries.</p> <h2>Efficiency</h2> <p>Students usually learn cofactor expansion as their first method of calculating determinants. This rule is easy to explain, but inefficient since the number of steps required is <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>!).</p> <p>The more efficient way to compute determinants is by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. As with condensation, one must avoid dividing by zero, hence the partial pivoting.</p> <p>Gaussian elimination takes <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>³) operations, and so does Dodgson’s condensation algorithm. Condensation is easy to teach and easy to carry out by hand, but unlike cofactor expansion it scales well.</p> <p>If a matrix has all integer entries, Gaussian elimination can produce non-integer values in intermediate steps. Condensation does not. Also, condensation is inherently parallelizable: each of the 2 × 2 determinants can be calculated simultaneously.</p> <h2>Related posts</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2023/05/16/matrix-adjugate/\">Cofactors, determinants, and adjugates</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2022/12/10/determinants-ones/\">Why determinants with a column of 1s?</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/applied-linear-algebra/\">Applied linear algebra</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- .entry-content --> <!-- .entry-meta -->"},{"id":"https://engineering.cmu.edu/news-events/news/2025/12/19-perfect-shot.html","title":"Researchers develop a camera that can focus on different distances at once","link":"https://engineering.cmu.edu/news-events/news/2025/12/19-perfect-shot.html","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46369808","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46369808\">Comments</a>","date":1766526156000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div> <p>Imagine snapping a photo where every detail, near and far, is perfectly sharp—from the flower petal right in front of you to the distant trees on the horizon. For over a century, camera designers have dreamed of achieving that level of clarity. In a breakthrough that could transform photography, microscopy, and even smartphone cameras, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a new kind of lens that can bring an entire scene into sharp focus at once—no matter how far away or close different parts of the scene are.</p> <p>The team, consisting of <a href=\"https://yingsiqin.github.io/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yingsi Qin</a>, an electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. student, <a href=\"https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/sankaranarayanan-aswin.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Aswin Sankaranarayanan,</a> professor of electrical and computer engineering, and <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~motoole2/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew O’Toole</a>, associate professor of computer science and robotics, <a href=\"https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/svaf/static/pdfs/Spatially_Varying_Autofocus.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">presented their findings</a> at the <a href=\"https://iccv.thecvf.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2025 International Conference on Computer Vision</a> and received a Best Paper Honorable Mention recognition.</p> <div> <figure> <img alt=\"Illustration comparing a conventional photo with a defined focal plane to an All-In-Focus photo showcasing its spatially-varying autofocused focal surface.\" src=\"https://engineering.cmu.edu/_files/images/news/2025/1219-em-perfect-shot.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"> <figcaption> <p>Left: A conventional photo with a regular lens, where objects at a single focal plane appear sharp. Right: An all-in-focus photo captured through spatially-varying autofocusing. To achieve this, we combine (i) a programmable lens with spatially-varying control over focus, and (ii) a spatially-varying autofocus algorithm to drive the focus of this lens. Note that this is an optically-captured image of a real scene with no post-capture processing used.</p> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Traditional camera lenses can only bring one flat layer of a scene into perfect focus at a time. Anything in front of or behind that layer turns soft and blurry. Narrowing the aperture can help, but it also dims the image and introduces new kinds of optical fuzziness caused by diffraction.</p> <p>“We’re asking the question, ‘What if a lens didn’t have to focus on just one plane at all?’” says Qin. “What if it could bend its focus to match the shape of the world in front of it?”</p> <p>The researchers developed a “computational lens”—a hybrid of optics and algorithm—that can adjust its focus differently for every part of a scene. The system builds on a design known as a Lohmann lens, which uses two curved, cubic lenses that shift against each other to tune focus. By combining this setup with a phase-only spatial light modulator—a device that controls how light bends at each pixel—the researchers were able to make different parts of the image focus at different depths simultaneously.</p> <p>The system uses two autofocus methods. The first is Contrast-Detection Autofocus (CDAF), which divides the image into regions called superpixels. Each region independently finds the focus setting that maximizes its sharpness. The second is Phase-Detection Autofocus (PDAF), which uses a dual-pixel sensor to detect not just whether something is in focus, but which direction to adjust. This makes it faster and better suited for moving scenes—the team achieved 21 frames per second with their modified sensor.</p> <p>“Together, they let the camera decide which parts of the image should be sharp—essentially giving each pixel its own tiny, adjustable lens,” explains O’Toole.</p> <blockquote> <p>Our system represents a novel category of optical design. One that could fundamentally change how cameras see the world.</p> <cite><strong>Aswin Sankaranarayanan</strong>, <em>Professor</em>, Electrical and Computer Engineering</cite> </blockquote> <p>Beyond its obvious appeal to photographers, the technology could have sweeping applications. Microscopes could capture every layer of a biological sample in focus at once. Autonomous vehicles might see their surroundings with unprecedented clarity. Even augmented and virtual reality systems could benefit, using similar optics to create more lifelike depth perception.</p> <p>“Our system represents a novel category of optical design,” says Sankaranarayanan. “One that could fundamentally change how cameras see the world.”</p> </div></div>"},{"id":"https://github.com/pranshuparmar/witr","title":"Show HN: Witr – Explain why a process is running on your Linux system","link":"https://github.com/pranshuparmar/witr","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46392910","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46392910\">Comments</a>","date":1766762436000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<h2 tabindex=\"-1\" dir=\"auto\">witr (why-is-this-running)</h2> <p dir=\"auto\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/4262592/530396425-adebb063-4706-47a8-9f77-612298354ef7.gif?jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.QhrYMkTA2Nc3w_QOlEFfIN0vm6G9RSmH5LWjp-ufcJ8\"><img src=\"https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/4262592/530396425-adebb063-4706-47a8-9f77-612298354ef7.gif?jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.QhrYMkTA2Nc3w_QOlEFfIN0vm6G9RSmH5LWjp-ufcJ8\" alt=\"witr\" data-animated-image=\"\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></a></p> <hr> <h2 tabindex=\"-1\" dir=\"auto\">1.

You get version history for free. Pull requests give you a review workflow. It’s distributed by design. GitHub will host it for free. Everyone already knows how to use it.</p> <p>Package managers keep falling for this. And it keeps not working out.</p> <h2 id=\"cargo\">Cargo</h2> <p>The crates.io index started as a git repository. Every Cargo client cloned it. This worked fine when the registry was small, but the index kept growing. Users would see progress bars like “Resolving deltas: 74.01%, (64415/95919)” hanging for ages, the visible symptom of Cargo’s libgit2 library grinding through <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9069\">delta resolution</a> on a repository with thousands of historic commits.</p> <p>The problem was worst in CI. Stateless environments would download the full index, use a tiny fraction of it, and throw it away. Every build, every time.</p> <p><a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2789-sparse-index.html\">RFC 2789</a> introduced a sparse HTTP protocol. Instead of cloning the whole index, Cargo now fetches files directly over HTTPS, downloading only the metadata for dependencies your project actually uses. (This is the “<a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/05/package-manager-tradeoffs.html\">full index replication vs on-demand queries</a>” tradeoff in action.) By April 2025, 99% of crates.io requests came from Cargo versions where sparse is the default. The git index still exists, still growing by thousands of commits per day, but most users never touch it.</p> <h2 id=\"homebrew\">Homebrew</h2> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9383\">GitHub explicitly asked Homebrew to stop using shallow clones.</a> Updating them was <a href=\"https://brew.sh/2023/02/16/homebrew-4.0.0/\">“an extremely expensive operation”</a> due to the tree layout and traffic of homebrew-core and homebrew-cask.</p> <p>Users were downloading 331MB just to unshallow homebrew-core. The .git folder approached 1GB on some machines. Every <code>brew update</code> meant waiting for git to grind through delta resolution.</p> <p>Homebrew 4.0.0 in February 2023 switched to JSON downloads for tap updates. The reasoning was blunt: “they are expensive to git fetch and git clone and GitHub would rather we didn’t do that… they are slow to git fetch and git clone and this provides a bad experience to end users.”</p> <p>Auto-updates now run every 24 hours instead of every 5 minutes, and they’re much faster because there’s no git fetch involved.</p> <h2 id=\"cocoapods\">CocoaPods</h2> <p>CocoaPods is the package manager for iOS and macOS development. It hit the limits hard. The Specs repo grew to hundreds of thousands of podspecs across a deeply nested directory structure. Cloning took minutes. Updating took minutes. CI time vanished into git operations.</p> <p>GitHub imposed CPU rate limits. The culprit was shallow clones, which force GitHub’s servers to compute which objects the client already has. The team tried various band-aids: stopping auto-fetch on <code>pod install</code>, converting shallow clones to full clones, <a href=\"https://blog.cocoapods.org/Sharding/\">sharding the repository</a>.</p> <p>The CocoaPods blog captured it well: <a href=\"https://blog.cocoapods.org/Master-Spec-Repo-Rate-Limiting-Post-Mortem/\">“Git was invented at a time when ‘slow network’ and ‘no backups’ were legitimate design concerns. Running endless builds as part of continuous integration wasn’t commonplace.”</a></p> <p>CocoaPods 1.8 <a href=\"https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-1.8.0-beta/\">gave up on git entirely</a> for most users. A CDN became the default, serving podspec files directly over HTTP. The migration saved users about a gigabyte of disk space and made <code>pod install</code> nearly instant for new setups.</p> <h2 id=\"nixpkgs\">Nixpkgs</h2> <p>Nix already solved the client-side problem. The package manager fetches expressions as <a href=\"https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.13.6/manual/package-management/channels.html\">tarballs via channels</a>, served from S3 and CDN, not git clones. Binary caches serve built packages over HTTP. End users never touch the git repository.</p> <p>But the repository itself is stress-testing GitHub’s infrastructure. In November 2025, GitHub contacted the NixOS team about <a href=\"https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixpkgs-core-team-update-2025-11-30-github-scaling-issues/72709\">periodic maintenance jobs failing</a> and causing “issues achieving consensus between replicas.” If unresolved, the repository could have become read-only.</p> <p>The repository totals 83GB with half a million tree objects and 20,000 forks. A local clone is only 2.5GB. The rest is GitHub’s fork network storing every pull request branch and merge commit. The CI queries mergeability daily, creating new merge commits each time.</p> <h2 id=\"vcpkg\">vcpkg</h2> <p>vcpkg is Microsoft’s C++ package manager. It uses git tree hashes to version its ports, with the curated registry at <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg\">github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg</a> containing over 2,000 libraries.</p> <p>The problem is that vcpkg needs to retrieve specific versions of ports by their git tree hash. When you specify a <code>builtin-baseline</code> in your vcpkg.json (functioning like a lockfile for reproducible builds), vcpkg looks up historical commits to find the exact port versions you need. This only works if you have the full commit history.</p> <p>Shallow clones break everything. GitHub Actions uses shallow clones by default. DevContainers <a href=\"https://github.com/devcontainers/images/issues/398\">shallow-clone vcpkg</a> to save space. CI systems optimize for fast checkouts. All of these result in the same error: “vcpkg was cloned as a shallow repository… Try again with a full vcpkg clone.”</p> <p>The workarounds are ugly. One <a href=\"https://github.com/devcontainers/images/issues/398\">proposed solution</a> involves parsing vcpkg.json to extract the baseline hash, deriving the commit date, then fetching with <code>--shallow-since=&lt;date&gt;</code>. Another suggests including twelve months of history, hoping projects upgrade before their baseline falls off the cliff. For GitHub Actions, you need <code>fetch-depth: 0</code> in your checkout step, <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/25349\">downloading the entire repository history</a> just to resolve dependencies.</p> <p>A vcpkg team member <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/25349\">explained the fundamental constraint</a>: “Port versions don’t use commit hashes, we use the git tree hash of the port directory. As far as I know, there is no way to deduce the commit that added a specific tree hash.” An in-product fix is infeasible. The architecture baked in git deeply enough that there’s no escape hatch.</p> <p>Unlike Cargo, Homebrew, and CocoaPods, vcpkg hasn’t announced plans to move away from git registries. Custom registries must still be git repositories. The documentation describes filesystem registries as an alternative, but these require local or mounted paths rather than HTTP access. There’s no CDN, no sparse protocol, no HTTP-based solution on the horizon.</p> <h2 id=\"go-modules\">Go modules</h2> <p><a href=\"https://engineering.grab.com/go-module-proxy\">Grab’s engineering team</a> went from 18 minutes for <code>go get</code> to 12 seconds after deploying a module proxy. That’s not a typo. Eighteen minutes down to twelve seconds.</p> <p>The problem was that <code>go get</code> needed to fetch each dependency’s source code just to read its go.mod file and resolve transitive dependencies. Cloning entire repositories to get a single file.</p> <p>Go had security concerns too. The original design wanted to remove version control tools entirely because <a href=\"https://arslan.io/2019/08/02/why-you-should-use-a-go-module-proxy/\">“these fragment the ecosystem: packages developed using Bazaar or Fossil, for example, are effectively unavailable to users who cannot or choose not to install these tools.”</a> Beyond fragmentation, the Go team worried about security bugs in version control systems becoming security bugs in <code>go get</code>. You’re not just importing code; you’re importing the attack surface of every VCS tool on the developer’s machine.</p> <p>GOPROXY became the default in Go 1.13. The proxy serves source archives and go.mod files independently over HTTP. Go also introduced a <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/21/federated-package-management.html#gos-experiment-with-dns\">checksum database (sumdb)</a> that records cryptographic hashes of module contents. This protects against force pushes silently changing tagged releases, and ensures modules remain available even if the original repository is deleted.</p> <h2 id=\"beyond-package-managers\">Beyond package managers</h2> <p>The same pattern shows up wherever developers try to use git as a database.</p> <p>Git-based wikis like Gollum (used by GitHub and GitLab) become <a href=\"https://github.com/gollum/gollum/issues/1940\">“somewhat too slow to be usable”</a> at scale. Browsing directory structure takes seconds per click. Loading pages takes longer. <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/wikis.html\">GitLab plans to move away from Gollum entirely.</a></p> <p>Git-based CMS platforms like Decap hit GitHub’s API rate limits. A Decap project on GitHub <a href=\"https://decapcms.org/blog/git-based-cms-definition-features-best-practices/\">scales to about 10,000 entries</a> if you have a lot of collection relations. A new user with an empty cache makes a request per entry to populate it, burning through the 5,000 request limit quickly. If your site has lots of content or updates frequently, use a database instead.</p> <p>Even GitOps tools that embrace git as a source of truth have to work around its limitations. ArgoCD’s repo server <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/\">can run out of disk space</a> cloning repositories. A single commit invalidates the cache for all applications in that repo. Large monorepos need special scaling considerations.</p> <h2 id=\"the-pattern\">The pattern</h2> <p>The hosting problems are symptoms. The underlying issue is that git inherits filesystem limitations, and filesystems make terrible databases.</p> <p><strong>Directory limits.</strong> Directories with too many files become slow. CocoaPods had <a href=\"https://blog.cocoapods.org/Sharding/\">16,000 pod directories</a> in a single Specs folder, requiring huge tree objects and expensive computation. Their fix was hash-based sharding: split directories by the first few characters of a hashed name, so no single directory has too many entries. Git itself does this internally with its objects folder, splitting into 256 subdirectories. You’re reinventing B-trees, badly.</p> <p><strong>Case sensitivity.</strong> Git is case-sensitive, but macOS and Windows filesystems typically aren’t. <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/os-compatibility\">Check out a repo containing both <code>File.txt</code> and <code>file.txt</code> on Windows</a>, and the second overwrites the first. <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/case-sensitivity\">Azure DevOps</a> had to add server-side enforcement to block pushes with case-conflicting paths.</p> <p><strong>Path length limits.</strong> Windows restricts paths to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation\">260 characters</a>, a constraint dating back to DOS. Git supports longer paths, but Git for Windows inherits the OS limitation. This is painful with deeply nested node_modules directories, where <code>git status</code> fails with “Filename too long” errors.</p> <p><strong>Missing database features.</strong> Databases have CHECK constraints and UNIQUE constraints; git has nothing, so every package manager builds its own validation layer. Databases have locking; git doesn’t. Databases have indexes for queries like “all packages depending on X”; with git you either traverse every file or build your own index. Databases have migrations for schema changes; git has “rewrite history and force everyone to re-clone.”</p> <p>The progression is predictable. Start with a flat directory of files. Hit filesystem limits. Implement sharding. Hit cross-platform issues. Build server-side enforcement. Build custom indexes. Eventually give up and use HTTP or an actual database. You’ve built a worse version of what databases already provide, spread across git hooks, CI pipelines, and bespoke tooling.</p> <p>None of this means git is bad. Git excels at what it was designed for: distributed collaboration on source code, with branching, merging, and offline work. The problem is using it for something else entirely. Package registries need fast point queries for metadata. Git gives you a full-document sync protocol when you need a key-value lookup.</p> <p>If you’re building a package manager and git-as-index seems appealing, look at Cargo, Homebrew, CocoaPods, vcpkg, Go. They all had to build workarounds as they grew, causing pain for users and maintainers. The pull request workflow is nice. The version history is nice. You will hit the same walls they did.</p> </div>"},{"id":"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=58650","title":"-tucky (2023)","link":"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=58650","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46372532","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46372532\">Comments</a>","date":1766551397000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div> <!--<p align=center>&laquo; <a href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=58647\">Signs of the phonetics of Moroccan French</a> | <a href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=58680\">Iowa town names</a> &raquo; </p>--> <p>« <a href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=58647\">previous post</a> | <a href=\"https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=58680\">next post</a> » </p> <p>Last weekend, I was in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska\">Omaha</a> for the annual <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway\">Berkshire-Hathaway</a> Shareholders Meeting.&nbsp; Not that I am a shareholder of Berkshire-Hathaway, but simply because I was curious to see two nonagenarian financial wizards hold forth in front of 20,000 enthusiastic fans for a whole day.&nbsp; I wasn't disappointed, though I must confess that I didn't understand half of what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett\">Warren Buffett</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger\">Charlie Munger</a> were saying about value investing.</p> <p>Since I was staying in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_Bluffs,_Iowa\">Council Bluffs</a> and the meeting was held at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHI_Health_Center_Omaha\">CHI Health Center</a> across the river in Omaha, I had to go back and forth across the Missouri River several times, so I became curious about the relationship between the two cities.&nbsp; I asked a taxi driver from Council Bluffs, who was born and grew up there, what local people thought of the twin cities.&nbsp; \"We're the one with all the problems,\" he said.&nbsp; \"So much so that they call us Counciltucky.</p> <p>I had never heard of that word before, and when I looked it up, I didn't like what I found, because it attaches serious stigma to the people of Council Bluffs.</p> <p>I told some friends about it, and they said, yes, and we have \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsyltucky\">Pennsyltucky</a>\" too.&nbsp; But when I looked that up, it wasn't nearly so demeaning as \"Counciltucky\".&nbsp; It basically just means Pennsylvania minus the <a title=\"Pittsburgh\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh\">Pittsburgh</a> and <a title=\"Philadelphia\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia\">Philadelphia</a> metropolitan areas.</p> <p>Curious about the apparent meaning of the suffix \"-tucky\", I looked up the etymology of \"Kentucky\", and this is what I found:</p> <p>Sometime before 1769, <a title=\"Botetourt County, Virginia\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botetourt_County,_Virginia\">Botetourt</a> and successor counties of <a title=\"Virginia Colony\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Colony\">Virginia Colony</a> whose geographical extent was south of the Ohio/Allegheny rivers beyond the <a title=\"Appalachian Mountains\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains\">Appalachian Mountains</a> became known to European Americans as <i><a title=\"Fincastle County, Virginia\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fincastle_County,_Virginia\">Kentucky (or Kentucke) country</a></i> named for the <a title=\"Kentucky River\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_River\">Kentucky River</a>, a tributary of the Ohio River in east central Kentucky. The precise etymology of the name is uncertain.</p> <p>One theory sees the word based on an <a title=\"Iroquoian languages\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquoian_languages\">Iroquoian</a> name meaning \"(on) the meadow\" or \"(on) the prairie\" (cf. <a title=\"Mohawk language\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_language\">Mohawk</a> <i><span title=\"Mohawk-language text\"><i lang=\"moh\">kenhtà:ke</i></span></i>, <a title=\"Seneca language\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_language\">Seneca</a> <i><span title=\"Seneca-language text\"><i lang=\"see\">gëdá'geh</i></span></i> (<a title=\"Phoneme\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme\">phonemic</a> <span lang=\"und-Latn-fonipa\" title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">/kɛ̃taʔkɛh/</span>), \"at the field\").</p> <p>Another theory suggests a derivation from the term <i><span title=\"Algonquian languages collective text\"><i lang=\"alg\">Kenta Aki</i></span></i>, which could have come from an <a title=\"Algonquian languages\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian_languages\">Algonquian language</a>, in particular from <a title=\"Shawnee\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawnee\">Shawnee</a>.

I figured out it was based around the character<!-- --> <span><span>_</span>ۗ</span> <i>AKA U+06D7 ARABIC LETTER ALEF WITH WAVY HAMZA ABOVE</i>. This character has a couple of unusual properties:</p><ul><li>It's a zero-width character. It takes up no horizontal space, the characters after it do not move horizontally because of it. These are generally used as special formatting purposes. To turn text right to left you can use U+200F (<i>RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK</i>) and U+200B (<i>ZERO WIDTH SPACE</i>) has famously caused programmers hell when it causes files to fail compiles for seemingly no reason.</li><li>It's a combining mark. Rather than being a standalone character, it attaches to and modifies the preceding character. Common examples include accents like é (e + U+0301<!-- --> <i>COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT</i>), umlauts like ü (u + U+0308<!-- --> <i>COMBINING DIAERESIS</i>), and tildes like ñ (n + U+0303<!-- --> <i>COMBINING TILDE</i>). The base letter and its marks form what Unicode calls a \"grapheme cluster\" — what we perceive as a single character.</li><li>It's stackable. When you place multiple combining marks next to each other, they don't overwrite — they stack vertically. Most combining marks can only be used one per base character: If I put 100 U+0301 <i>COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT</i> after an \"e\", I still just get an \"é\" with one accent. But with certain characters, including U+06D7 ARABIC LETTER ALEF WITH WAVY HAMZA ABOVE, you can stack multiple instances on top of each other, creating towers<!-- -->ۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛ</li></ul><p>After doing a review of unicode characters, I was able to find 19 characters with these traits. 16 stacking upwards, 3 stacking downwards. After looking at them all (and asking ChatGPT), I realized they are all Arabic characters used in the Qur'an, referred to as Tajweed marks.</p><br><h2>۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۫۫۫۫۫۫۫۫۫۫<!-- -->Combining Marks and Constructing Images/Patterns<!-- -->۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۫۫۫۫۫۫۫۫۫۫</h2><p>These characters stack in two independent directions: the above marks and below marks. You can mix and match any of these marks together, and they'll continue to grow vertically until you add a non-combining character to reset the stack. This allows for some interesting effects, as you can create tall towers of marks both above and below a base character.</p><div><div><p>A<span>ۜۢۛۜۢۛۜۢۛۜۢۛۜۢۛ</span></p><p>seen + meemIsolated + threeDots</p></div><div><p>B<span>ۙۚۨ۫ۙۚۨ۫ۙۚۨ۫ۙۚۨ۫</span></p><p>lamAlef + jeem + noon + emptyCenterHigh</p></div><div><p>C<span>ۣۣۣۣۣۣۣۭۭۭۭۭۭۭ</span></p><p>below: seen + lowMeem</p></div><div><p>D<span>ۣۭۣۭۣۭۣۭۣۭۜۢۜۢۜۢۜۢۜۢ</span></p><p>above + below combined</p></div></div><p>As a series of unique characters, using the density of their coloring you can draw images or patterns with them using the same techniques as ASCII art.

that worked, I wrote a new calibrator that incorporated all of the upwards marks and a new grayscale translator that lets me take any image and convert it into marks like these. Despite these strings having a length of thousands of characters and rendering to this, the dom registers their text as a series of empty spaces; these entire images are just a single line of text. Calibration worked by taking all of the symbols and lining up 50 of each of them side by side, then adjusting the amounts of them till they all had approximately the same height.

Across Platforms</h2><ul><li><h3>Twitter</h3> I first noticed these characters rendering strangely on Twitter. Twitter has since patched their CSS to not let it work in all the places it used to, but it still messes with notifications recieved from users who have it in their bio. I've heard of it clipping/not clipping on lots of platforms, and I've personally seen the behavior change back and forth over time.<p><img src=\"https://zw.swerdlow.dev/twitter-bio.jpeg\" alt=\"Twitter bio with stacking marks\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><img src=\"https://zw.swerdlow.dev/twitter-notifications.jpeg\" alt=\"Twitter notifications affected by stacking marks\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><img src=\"https://zw.swerdlow.dev/twitter-sidebar.jpeg\" alt=\"Twitter sidebar with stacking marks\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p></li><li><h3>GitHub</h3> GitHub lets you write these everywhere, but generally clips them before they can overflow in weird ways. The most interesting behavior I found was in the repository list.<p><img src=\"https://zw.swerdlow.dev/github-in-repo.png\" alt=\"GitHub in-repo view with stacking marks\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><img src=\"https://zw.swerdlow.dev/github-repo-list.png\" alt=\"GitHub repository list with stacking marks\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p></li><li><h3>Google</h3> these seem to be fine on Google Search Results if you can get them in there. It doesn't show up on Safari Google or Safari in general for me.<p><img src=\"https://zw.swerdlow.dev/google-bio.png\" alt=\"Google search results with stacking marks\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p></li></ul><h2>Why this happens and why it only happens on some sites?</h2><p>As extremely rare characters, many fonts just ignore them. Other fonts like Verdana (the font hacker news uses) renders these characters inline/non vertically stacked. One of the unique properties about these is despite obviously taking up space, they don't modify the bounding box of the text they are attached to. While most text would be expected to expand/shape the bounding box around it, these marks are ignored by it. However it doesn't ignore them — when overflow is set to none or hidden the marks are clipped outside of the bounding box.</p><div><h3>Try it yourself</h3><div><p><span>Output</span></p><p>Result

W.H. Auden imagined the likely harsh conditions in his poem “<a href=\"https://hellopoetry.com/poem/788/roman-wall-blues/\">Roman Wall Blues</a>,” in which a soldier laments enduring wet wind and rain with “lice in my tunic and a cold in my nose.” We can now add chronic nausea and bouts of diarrhea to his list of likely woes, thanks to parasitic infections, according to a new paper published in the journal Parasitology.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/this-ancient-roman-ceramic-pot-was-probably-a-portable-toilet-study-finds/\">previously reported</a>, archaeologists can learn a great deal by studying the remains of intestinal parasites in ancient feces. For instance, in 2022, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/intestinal-parasites-plagued-jerusalems-wealthy-elite-toilet-excavation-reveals/\">we reported</a> on an analysis of soil samples collected from a stone toilet found within the ruins of a swanky 7th-century BCE villa just outside Jerusalem. That analysis revealed the presence of parasitic eggs from four different species: whipworm, beef/pork tapeworm, roundworm, and pinworm. (It’s the earliest record of roundworm and pinworm in ancient Israel.)</p> <p>Later that same year, researchers from the University of Cambridge and the University of British Columbia <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/this-ancient-roman-ceramic-pot-was-probably-a-portable-toilet-study-finds/\">analyzed</a> the residue on an ancient Roman ceramic pot excavated at the site of a 5th-century CE Roman villa at Gerace, a rural district in Sicily. They identified the eggs of intestinal parasitic worms commonly found in feces—strong evidence that the 1,500-year-old pot in question was most likely used as a chamber pot.</p> <p>Other prior studies have compared fecal parasites found in hunter-gatherer and farming communities, revealing dramatic dietary changes, as well as shifts in settlement patterns and social organization coinciding with the rise of agriculture. This latest paper analyzes sediment collected from sewer drains at the Roman fort at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda\">Vindolanda</a>, located just south of the defense fortification known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall\">Hadrian’s Wall</a>.</p> <p>An antiquarian named William Camden recorded the existence of the ruins in a 1586 treatise. Over the next 200 years, many people visited the site, discovering a military bathhouse in 1702 and an altar in 1715. &nbsp;Another altar found in 1914 confirmed that the fort had been called Vindolanda. Serious archaeological excavation at the site began in the 1930s.

That can be discouraging, since luck feels like a force outside our control. But the good news is that we can increase our chances of encountering good luck. That may sound like magic, but it’s not supernatural. The trick is to increase the number of opportunities we have for good fortune to find us. The simple act of publishing your work is one of the best ways to invite a little more luck into your life.</p> <p>Before we get into the “how,” it’s important to get on the same page about the “what.” What are we talking about when we say “luck?” There are a lot of definitions that could apply, but let’s stick with a simple one: Luck is when something unexpected and good happens to you. Unexpected and good. Who doesn’t want to increase the odds of something unexpected and good?</p> <p>In our world, luck can include:</p> <ul><li><p>Having your OSS library take off</p></li><li><p>Being invited to speak at a conference</p></li><li><p>Landing a new job</p></li><li><p>Getting a new consulting client</p></li><li><p>Being invited onto a podcast</p></li><li><p>Making new friends in your community</p></li></ul> <p>None of these things are totally in your control, which can at times feel frustrating.&nbsp;</p> <p>How can we increase the odds of finding luck? By being a person who works in public. By doing work and being public about it, you build a reputation for yourself. You build a track record. You build a public body of work that speaks on your behalf better than any resume ever could.</p> <p>The goal is not to become famous, the goal is to increase the chances of luck finding us. For me, one of the most helpful ways to think about this has always been the concept of the “Luck Surface Area,” described in an <a href=\"https://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area\"><u>old post by Jason Roberts</u></a>. He wrote (and note, the emphasis is mine):&nbsp;</p> <p><i>\"The amount of serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck Surface Area, is directly proportional to the degree to which you </i><i><b>do something</b></i><i> you’re passionate about combined with the total number of people to whom this is </i><i><b>effectively communicated</b></i><i>.\"</i></p> <p>Going further, he codifies it into a formula where:</p> <div tabindex=\"0\"> <pre><span><span>Luck</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>Doing</span> <span>Things</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>[</span><span>Telling</span> <span>People</span><span>]</span></span></pre> </div> <p>The more things you do multiplied by the more people you tell, the larger your Luck Surface Area becomes. The larger your Luck Surface Area, the more likely you are to catch luck as it flows by.</p> <picture> <source srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=468&amp;fm=avif 468w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=374&amp;fm=avif 374w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=280&amp;fm=avif 280w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=234&amp;fm=avif 234w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=187&amp;fm=avif 187w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=93&amp;fm=avif 93w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 930px) 90vw, 840px\" type=\"image/avif\"> <source srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=468&amp;fm=webp 468w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=374&amp;fm=webp 374w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=280&amp;fm=webp 280w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=234&amp;fm=webp 234w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=187&amp;fm=webp 187w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=93&amp;fm=webp 93w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 930px) 90vw, 840px\" type=\"image/webp\"> <source srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=468&amp;fm=jpg 468w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=374&amp;fm=jpg 374w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=280&amp;fm=jpg 280w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=234&amp;fm=jpg 234w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=187&amp;fm=jpg 187w,https://images.ctfassets.net/s5uo95nf6njh/1mf4WuCw33UGsrQTdkErFe/1b5c74f7b54deb664b6bb39aa6303d35/AF_inline.jpg?w=93&amp;fm=jpg 93w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 930px) 90vw, 840px\" type=\"image/jpeg\"> <img width=\"468\" height=\"342\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"A graph with &quot;Doing&quot; on the Y axis, and &quot;Telling&quot; on the X axis.

The good news for you is that by even reading this Guide on The ReadME Project, you’ve probably already self-selected into a group of people for whom “doing things” comes somewhat naturally. You’re a developer, a designer, a creator, an author, or something else entirely.&nbsp; Whatever moniker you want to give yourself, you’re built to <i>do</i> things, and that’s the important part.&nbsp;</p> <p>If that doesn’t ring true for you, you may fall into one of two groups:</p> <ol><li><p>You actually <i>are</i> doing things, you’ve just trained yourself to think that anything you do isn’t worth sharing.</p></li><li><p>You <i>want</i> to be doing things, but you can’t bring yourself to get started.</p></li></ol> <p>If you’re in the first group, you may need to step back and reframe the work you’re already doing. This is a common blind spot for people who are executing at a high level! They’ve forgotten just how much they know. They think that they’re not doing anything interesting because they assume that everyone knows as much as they do. This effect is only exacerbated when everyone in your immediate vicinity is at a similar—or higher—skill level. As you become more of an expert, your quality bar gets higher and higher and you forget that everything you know is not known by everyone.</p> <p>If you’re in this group I want to give you a challenge: Watch the communities where you hang out and see what people are sharing and what gets noticed. Is it something you could have done? Is it something you’ve <i>already</i> done? At its worst this could lead you in the direction of becoming bitter, critical, and thinking that you’re smarter than everyone. To that I say “resist!” There is no life there. My encouragement to you is to view that as objective evidence that people want to know all of the things that you already know! There is a huge opportunity for you, should you decide to start sharing your work.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you’re in the second group, you just need to start. Start anywhere, start on anything, start something. You’ll never come up with the perfect idea for an OSS library, a business, a podcast, or an article by just thinking about it. Start on something, today. It won’t be the perfect version of the thing you have in your head, but you’ll be in motion. Motion begets motion, progress begets progress. Pick the smallest thing you can do and get started.</p> <p>Doing the work is the most important part. It’s the nucleus around which everything else revolves. What that “work” looks like, though, is entirely up to you! That’s the fun part. It can take any form and be in any domain. Wherever your curiosity or expertise draw you, dive into that.&nbsp;</p> <p>Projects outside of work are a good place to dive into your curiosity.&nbsp;</p> <ul><li><p>If you want to make<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aschmelyun/status/1506960015063625733\"><u> a thermal receipt printer that prints GitHub issues</u></a>, you should.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>If you want to<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aarondfrancis/status/1333866090573811723\"><u> turn a prefabricated shed into an office</u></a>, go for it.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>If you want to go all in on an<a href=\"https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1419048412431933441\"><u> SVG drawing tool</u></a>, do it.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>If you want to write tens of thousands of words about <a href=\"https://bam.kalzumeus.com/archive/\"><u>the infrastructure of modern money</u></a>, that’s a newsletter.&nbsp;</p></li></ul> <p>Your curiosity will naturally pull you in certain directions, so don’t be afraid to go super deep into a topic that you’re interested in. When a person is truly interested in the thing they’re writing or talking about, their excitement is contagious. Whatever you’re excited about, be excited about it publicly. Whatever you’re curious about, be curious about it publicly. People will want to follow along and you’ll inspire people along the way.</p> <p>Projects at work can be a good place to dive into your expertise.&nbsp;</p> <p>It's likely you're constantly solving problems and learning interesting things at your job. This is a great opportunity to take what you’re already doing and repurpose it for the benefit of others. You can turn those learnings into blog posts, conference talks, meetups, podcasts, or open source projects.&nbsp;</p> <p>Of course not everything you do at work is shareable. If the specifics aren’t shareable, the concepts, lessons, and takeaways likely are. While you’re working, keep a scratch pad open and jot down any problems you come across, interesting patterns you see, or things you found confusing. Do this for a month and you’ll have more things to share than you know what to do with!</p> <p>You’ve done the work, now it's time to tell people.</p> <h2>Hitting the publish button</h2> <p>This part of the formula can be harder for most of us. Most of us really enjoy the building aspect but start to get a little shy when it comes to telling people about the stuff we’ve built. That could be for any number of reasons: fear, embarrassment, self-preservation, or an aversion to being perceived as hawking your wares.</p> <p>It’s a valuable exercise to investigate whether or not you resonate with any of those reasons. Are you afraid people are going to make fun of what you built? Are you embarrassed that it isn’t up to your own (admittedly high) standards? Are you waiting for some elusive perfect moment? Do you have an aversion to “marketing” and don’t want to become the thing you hate? Whatever it is for you, I encourage you to really dig into it and see if that fear is worth keeping around.</p> <p>Sharing things you’re learning or making is not prideful. People are drawn to other people in motion. People <i>want</i> to follow along, people <i>want</i> to learn things, people <i>want</i> to be a part of your journey. It’s not bragging to say, “I’ve made a thing and I think it’s cool!” Bringing people along is a good thing for everyone. By publishing your work you’re helping people learn. You’re inspiring others to create.</p> <p>You can “publish” anywhere. For me that’s mostly Twitter because that’s where most of my peers hang out. It doesn’t have to be Twitter for you. It could be GitHub, a newsletter, a podcast, forums, your blog, YouTube, or something completely different that’s not even on my radar. Anywhere that’s not your hard drive counts!&nbsp;</p> <p>Publishing is a skill, it’s something you can learn. You’ll need to build your publishing skill just like you built every other skill you have.&nbsp;</p> <p>Don’t be afraid to publish along the way. You don’t have to wait until you’re done to drop a perfect, finished artifact from the sky (in fact, you may use that as an excuse to <i>never</i> publish). People like stories, so use that to your benefit. Share the wins, the losses, and the thought processes. Bring us along! If you haven’t been in the habit of sharing your work, it’s going to feel weird when you start. That’s normal! Keep going, you get used to it.&nbsp;</p> <p>You’ve done the work. You’ve hit the publish button. You’ve done your part!&nbsp;</p> <h2>Capturing the luck</h2> <p>You’ve <i>increased the odds</i> that good, unexpected things will come your way. The exact form is hard to predict, but here are a few potential outcomes:&nbsp;</p> <ul><li><p>People start to know you as the person that talks about X, Y, and Z.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You start to get emails from people saying that they read your stuff and liked it.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You get a DM about a job you might be interested in.</p></li><li><p>People ask you if you’re taking on new clients.</p></li><li><p>Someone you’ve never met or interacted with will mention you as being an expert in your area.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>A meetup asks you to come talk about the things you’ve been sharing.</p></li><li><p>You become friends with other people in your industry.</p></li><li><p>Your OSS library starts gaining mindshare.</p></li></ul> <p>This is not a random list of made-up examples, it’s a list of things that have literally happened to me once I got over my fears and started sharing my work. I had been doing the work all along, but was too afraid to publish. Once I overcame that fear, my Luck Surface Area expanded and good, unexpected things started happening.&nbsp;</p> <p>The formula is simple.</p> <p>Do the work. Don’t be afraid to dive deep into your curiosity and your expertise. We need more people that are intensely curious. We need more people with deep expertise.</p> <p>Tell people. Press publish, bring us along, share the journey. Tell us what you’ve learned, what you’ve built, or what you’re excited about.</p> <p>The formula may be simple, but I’ll admit it’s not always easy. It’s scary to put yourself out there. It’s hard to open yourself up to criticism. People online can be mean. But for every snarky comment, there are ten times as many people quietly following along and admiring not only your work, but your bravery to put it out publicly. And at some point, one of those people quietly following along will reach out with a life-changing opportunity and you’ll think, “Wow, that was lucky.”</p> </div></div>"},{"id":"https://xania.org/202512/20-simd-city","title":"SIMD City: Auto-Vectorisation","link":"https://xania.org/202512/20-simd-city","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46336019","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46336019\">Comments</a>","date":1766237140000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div> <h2>SIMD City: Auto-vectorisation</h2> <p>Written by me, proof-read by an LLM. <br>Details at end.</p> <p>It’s time to look at one of the most sophisticated optimisations compilers can do: autovectorisation. Most “big data” style problems boil down to “do this maths to huge arrays”, and the limiting factor isn’t the maths itself, but the feeding of instructions to the CPU, along with the data it needs.</p> <p>To help with this problem, CPU designers came up with SIMD: “Single Instruction, Multiple Data”. One instruction tells the CPU what to do with a whole chunk of data. These chunks could be 2, 4, 8, 16 or similar units of integers or floating point values, all treated individually. Initially<sup id=\"fnref:games\"><a href=\"#fn:games\">1</a></sup> the only way to use this capability was to write assembly language directly, but luckily for us, compilers are now able to help.</p> <p>To take advantage of SIMD we need to ensure our data is laid out in a nice long line, like an array, or vector<sup id=\"fnref:vectorisation\"><a href=\"#fn:vectorisation\">3</a></sup>. It’s also much better to store different “fields” of the data in separate arrays<sup id=\"fnref:acton\"><a href=\"#fn:acton\">2</a></sup>. We’re going to start with some integer maths - let’s update an array <code>x</code> to be element-wise the max of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>:</p> <p>In this <code>-O2</code>-compiled code<sup id=\"fnref:temp\"><a href=\"#fn:temp\">4</a></sup>, we don’t see any vectorisation, just the nice tight loop code we’ve come to expect:</p> <div><pre><code><span>.L3:</span> <span>mov</span><span>edx</span><span>,</span><span>DWORD</span><span>PTR</span><span>[</span><span>rsi</span><span>+</span><span>rax</span><span>*</span><span>4</span><span>]</span><span>; read y[i]</span> <span>cmp</span><span>edx</span><span>,</span><span>DWORD</span><span>PTR</span><span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>+</span><span>rax</span><span>*</span><span>4</span><span>]</span><span>; compare with x[i]</span> <span>jle</span><span>.L2</span><span>; if less, skip next instr</span> <span>mov</span><span>DWORD</span><span>PTR</span><span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>+</span><span>rax</span><span>*</span><span>4</span><span>],</span><span>edx</span><span>; x[i] = y[i]</span> <span>.L2:</span> <span>add</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>; ++i</span> <span>cmp</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span><span>65536</span><span>; are we at 65536?</span> <span>jne</span><span>.L3</span><span>; keep looping if not</span> </code></pre></div> <p>To ramp up to the next level, we’ll need to add two flags: first we need to turn up the optimiser to <code>-O3</code><sup id=\"fnref:or\"><a href=\"#fn:or\">5</a></sup>, and then we need to tell the compiler to target a CPU that has the appropriate SIMD instruction<sup id=\"fnref:most\"><a href=\"#fn:most\">6</a></sup> with something like <code>-march=skylake</code>.</p> <p>Our inner loop has gotten a little more complex, but spot the cool part:</p> <div><pre><code><span>.L4:</span> <span>; Reads 8 integers into ymm1, y[i..i+7]</span> <span>vmovdqu</span><span>ymm1</span><span>,</span><span>YMMWORD</span><span>PTR</span><span>[</span><span>rsi</span><span>+</span><span>rax</span><span>]</span> <span>; Compares that with 8 integers x[i..i+7]</span> <span>vpcmpgtd</span><span>ymm0</span><span>,</span><span>ymm1</span><span>,</span><span>YMMWORD</span><span>PTR</span><span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>+</span><span>rax</span><span>]</span> <span>; Were all 8 values less or equal?</span> <span>vptest</span><span>ymm0</span><span>,</span><span>ymm0</span> <span>; if so, skip the write</span> <span>je</span><span>.L3</span> <span>; mask move x[i..i+7] with the y values that were greater</span> <span>vpmaskmovd</span><span>YMMWORD</span><span>PTR</span><span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>+</span><span>rax</span><span>],</span><span>ymm0</span><span>,</span><span>ymm1</span> <span>.L3:</span> <span>add</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span><span>32</span><span>; move forward 32 bytes</span> <span>cmp</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span><span>262144</span><span>; are we at the end?

This is the power of SIMD - we’d likely be limited by the bandwidth to memory rather than the housekeeping of working out what to do with them.</p> <p>There are a couple of things to talk about though. Firstly, what’s all this “mask move” stuff? Well, with SIMD we can act on “multiple data” but only with a “single instruction”. Our original code has a conditional update: not every array element is necessarily processed in the same way. The compiler has cleverly used a “mask move” to let it <em>conditionally</em> write back only the elements that are “greater than”, which is pretty clever of it. We can help it if we don’t mind unconditionally writing to memory:</p> <p>By unconditionally writing to <code>x[i]</code><sup id=\"fnref:ok\"><a href=\"#fn:ok\">7</a></sup> we can reduce the loop to:</p> <div><pre><code><span>.L3:</span> <span>; Read 8 integers from x[i..i+7]</span> <span>vmovdqu</span><span>ymm0</span><span>,</span><span>YMMWORD</span><span>PTR</span><span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>+</span><span>rax</span><span>]</span> <span>; \"max\" the integers with y[i..i+7]</span> <span>vpmaxsd</span><span>ymm0</span><span>,</span><span>ymm0</span><span>,</span><span>YMMWORD</span><span>PTR</span><span>[</span><span>rsi</span><span>+</span><span>rax</span><span>]</span> <span>; Store them back</span> <span>vmovdqu</span><span>YMMWORD</span><span>PTR</span><span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>+</span><span>rax</span><span>],</span><span>ymm0</span> <span>add</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span><span>32</span><span>; move forward 32 bytes</span> <span>cmp</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span><span>262144</span><span>; are we at the end?</span> <span>jne</span><span>.L3</span><span>; keep looping if not</span> </code></pre></div> <p>The compiler has spotted our ternary operator is actually exactly the same as the built-in vector “max” instruction! No explicit comparisons or branches now - fantastic.</p> <p>There’s one last thing to cover - the eagle-eyed amongst you might have spotted the fact there are actually <em>two</em> loops, one using vector instructions, and one doing regular one-at-a-time operations. The regular loop is jumped to conditionally after this check:</p> <div><pre><code><span>lea</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span><span>[</span><span>rdi-4</span><span>]</span><span>; rax = x - 4</span> <span>sub</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span><span>rsi</span><span>; rax = x - 4 - y</span> <span>cmp</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span><span>24</span><span>; compare rax with 24</span> <span>mov</span><span>eax</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>; (set up loop counter for below)</span> <span>jbe</span><span>.L2</span><span>; if rax &lt;= 24; jump to the slow case</span> <span>; falls through to the vectorised loop here</span> </code></pre></div> <p>So what’s going on here? We’re checking <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> - not the <em>values</em> of the two arrays, but the addresses. That somewhat awkward sequence is essentially saying “do the two arrays overlap with each other in a way that would prevent us being able to vectorise”. If they overlap by 28 or more bytes, then we can’t read and write in 8 <code>int</code> (32-byte) chunks: working in batches like this would give different results as the overlap means writing to <code>x[i]</code> might affect <code>y[i+2]</code> (or similar). So, the compiler has to add this check <em>and</em> generate a fall-back case that does one at a time.</p> <p>With some non-standard trickery we tell the compiler to ignore vector dependencies for the loop<sup id=\"fnref:restrict\"><a href=\"#fn:restrict\">8</a></sup>:</p> <p>That’s it for today: with the right flags and a little care about data layout, the compiler can turn your one-at-a-time loops into batch-processing powerhouses!

Glad to have you with us.”</p> <p>In addition to Bruno’s work at ULA, which saw the launches of numerous government satellites to a variety of orbits, he previously worked for decades at Lockheed Martin, where he had a hand in a number of weapons systems, like the Air Force’s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Reentry Systems, the Navy’s Trident 2 D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) and the Missile Defense Agency’s Terminal High Area Altitude Defense (THAAD).</p> <p>Bruno was President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of United Launch Alliance for more than a decade. He led the company through the transition from Atlas and Delta rockets to the Vulcan rocket, which has a first-stage powered by Blue Origin’s BE-4 engines.</p> <p>That launch vehicle made its debut in January 2024, completed two certification flights and was approved by the U.S. Space Force to launch national security payloads. The first of those payloads, the USSF-106 mission, launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Aug. 12, 2025.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_70526\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70526\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250812_Vulcan_USSF-106_liftoff_MC-2-678x381.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"678\" height=\"381\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-70526\">United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket roared off the pad at Space Launch Complex 41 to begin the USSF-106 mission for the U.S. Space Force.

My Duty was complete,” Bruno wrote in a Dec. 26 social media post. “There is a new set of national security capabilities that need to be created ASAP. Blue is the best place for me to serve that mission.”</p> <p>Bruno’s transition comes as Blue Origin is finding its footing on the orbital launch front. It’s heavy lift rocket, New Glenn, launched its first two missions successfully in 2025 and managed to land one of its boosters on its recovery vessel, ‘Jacklyn.’</p> <p>Blue Origin is one of three companies, alongside ULA and SpaceX, that was recognized by the Space Force to be allowed to launch its most valuable and sensitive satellites. The contract, which is officially called National Security Space Launch Phase 3 Lane 2, was announced in April 2025, with seven missions planned for assignment to Blue Origin (though no specific missions have been awarded as of yet).</p> <p>The company, founded by billionaire and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, opted for a certification path that will require Blue Origin to launch four successful flights with New Glenn, followed by a thorough data review by the government.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_24045\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24045\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_3586-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"675\" height=\"506\" sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-24045\">Rob Meyerson, Blue Origin’s president, presents a photo of the BE-4 engine being mounted on a test stand in West Texas during remarks at the 33rd Space Symposium on April 5, 2017.

As history played out, Blue Origin didn’t deliver the first flight engines to ULA until October 2022 and the first flight of Vulcan was delayed until January 2024.</p> <p>Time will tell what types of government-focused initiatives Bruno will bring to Blue Origin as it looks to flex its muscles as it competes for more of the billions of dollars of national security contracts in the future.</p> </div></div>"},{"id":"https://twitter.com/FFmpeg/status/2004599109559496984","title":"FFmpeg has issued a DMCA takedown on GitHub","link":"https://twitter.com/FFmpeg/status/2004599109559496984","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46394327","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46394327\">Comments</a>","date":1766771305000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false}]}
