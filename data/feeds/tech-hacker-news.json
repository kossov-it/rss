The usual explanation is “it’s written in Rust.” That’s true, but it doesn’t explain much. Plenty of tools are written in Rust without being notably fast. The interesting question is what design decisions made the difference.</p> <p>Charlie Marsh’s <a href=\"https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/uv-an-extremely-fast-python-package-manager/\">Jane Street talk</a> and a <a href=\"https://xebia.com/blog/uv-the-engineering-secrets-behind-pythons-speed-king/\">Xebia engineering deep-dive</a> cover the technical details well. The interesting parts are the design decisions: standards that enable fast paths, things uv drops that pip supports, and optimizations that don’t require Rust at all.</p> <h2 id=\"the-standards-that-made-uv-possible\">The standards that made uv possible</h2> <p>pip’s slowness isn’t a failure of implementation. For years, Python packaging required executing code to find out what a package needed.</p> <p>The problem was <a href=\"https://setuptools.pypa.io/\">setup.py</a>. You couldn’t know a package’s dependencies without running its setup script. But you couldn’t run its setup script without installing its build dependencies. <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/\">PEP 518</a> in 2016 called this out explicitly: “You can’t execute a setup.py file without knowing its dependencies, but currently there is no standard way to know what those dependencies are in an automated fashion without executing the setup.py file.”</p> <p>This chicken-and-egg problem forced pip to download packages, execute untrusted code, fail, install missing build tools, and try again. Every install was potentially a cascade of subprocess spawns and arbitrary code execution. Installing a source distribution was essentially <code>curl | bash</code> with extra steps.</p> <p>The fix came in stages:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/\">PEP 518</a> (2016) created pyproject.toml, giving packages a place to declare build dependencies without code execution. The TOML format was borrowed from Rust’s Cargo, which makes a Rust tool returning to fix Python packaging feel less like coincidence.</li> <li><a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/\">PEP 517</a> (2017) separated build frontends from backends, so pip didn’t need to understand setuptools internals.</li> <li><a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/\">PEP 621</a> (2020) standardized the <code>[project]</code> table, so dependencies could be read by parsing TOML rather than running Python.</li> <li><a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0658/\">PEP 658</a> (2022) put package metadata directly in the Simple Repository API, so resolvers could fetch dependency information without downloading wheels at all.</li> </ul> <p>PEP 658 went live on PyPI in May 2023. uv launched in February 2024. uv could be fast because the ecosystem finally had the infrastructure to support it. A tool like uv couldn’t have shipped in 2020. The standards weren’t there yet.</p> <p>Other ecosystems figured this out earlier. Cargo has had static metadata from the start. npm’s package.json is declarative. Python’s packaging standards finally bring it to parity.</p> <h2 id=\"what-uv-drops\">What uv drops</h2> <p>Speed comes from elimination. Every code path you don’t have is a code path you don’t wait for.</p> <p>uv’s <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/\">compatibility documentation</a> is a list of things it doesn’t do:</p> <p><strong>No .egg support.</strong> Eggs were the pre-wheel binary format. pip still handles them; uv doesn’t even try. The format has been obsolete for over a decade.</p> <p><strong>No pip.conf.</strong> uv ignores pip’s configuration files entirely. No parsing, no environment variable lookups, no inheritance from system-wide and per-user locations.</p> <p><strong>No bytecode compilation by default.</strong> pip compiles .py files to .pyc during installation. uv skips this step, shaving time off every install. You can opt in if you want it.</p> <p><strong>Virtual environments required.</strong> pip lets you install into system Python by default. uv inverts this, refusing to touch system Python without explicit flags. This removes a whole category of permission checks and safety code.</p> <p><strong>Stricter spec enforcement.</strong> pip accepts malformed packages that technically violate packaging specs. uv rejects them. Less tolerance means less fallback logic.</p> <p><strong>Ignoring requires-python upper bounds.</strong> When a package says it requires <code>python&lt;4.0</code>, uv ignores the upper bound and only checks the lower. This reduces resolver backtracking dramatically since upper bounds are almost always wrong. Packages declare <code>python&lt;4.0</code> because they haven’t tested on Python 4, not because they’ll actually break. The constraint is defensive, not predictive.</p> <p><strong>First-index wins by default.</strong> When multiple package indexes are configured, pip checks all of them. uv picks from the first index that has the package, stopping there. This prevents dependency confusion attacks and avoids extra network requests.</p> <p>Each of these is a code path pip has to execute and uv doesn’t.</p> <h2 id=\"optimizations-that-dont-need-rust\">Optimizations that don’t need Rust</h2> <p>Some of uv’s speed comes from Rust. But not as much as you’d think. Several key optimizations could be implemented in pip today:</p> <p><strong>HTTP range requests for metadata.</strong> <a href=\"https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/\">Wheel files</a> are zip archives, and zip archives put their file listing at the end. uv tries PEP 658 metadata first, falls back to HTTP range requests for the zip central directory, then full wheel download, then building from source. Each step is slower and riskier. The design makes the fast path cover 99% of cases. None of this requires Rust.</p> <p><strong>Parallel downloads.</strong> pip downloads packages one at a time. uv downloads many at once. Any language can do this.</p> <p><strong>Global cache with hardlinks.</strong> pip copies packages into each virtual environment. uv keeps one copy globally and uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link\">hardlinks</a> (or copy-on-write on filesystems that support it). Installing the same package into ten venvs takes the same disk space as one. Any language with filesystem access can do this.</p> <p><strong>Python-free resolution.</strong> pip needs Python running to do anything, and invokes build backends as subprocesses to get metadata from legacy packages. uv parses TOML and wheel metadata natively, only spawning Python when it hits a setup.py-only package that has no other option.</p> <p><strong>PubGrub resolver.</strong> uv uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/blob/master/doc/solver.md\">PubGrub algorithm</a>, originally from Dart’s pub package manager. pip uses a backtracking resolver. PubGrub is faster at finding solutions and better at explaining failures. pip could adopt PubGrub without rewriting in Rust.</p> <h2 id=\"where-rust-actually-matters\">Where Rust actually matters</h2> <p>Some optimizations do require Rust:</p> <p><strong>Zero-copy deserialization.</strong> uv uses <a href=\"https://rkyv.org/\">rkyv</a> to deserialize cached data without copying it. The data format is the in-memory format. This is a Rust-specific technique.</p> <p><strong>Lock-free concurrent data structures.</strong> Rust’s ownership model makes concurrent access safe without locks. Python’s GIL makes this difficult.</p> <p><strong>No interpreter startup.</strong> Every time pip spawns a subprocess, it pays Python’s startup cost. uv is a single static binary with no runtime to initialize.</p> <p><strong>Compact version representation.</strong> uv packs versions into u64 integers where possible, making comparison and hashing fast. Over 90% of versions fit in one u64. This is micro-optimization that compounds across millions of comparisons.</p> <p>These are real advantages. But they’re smaller than the architectural wins from dropping legacy support and exploiting modern standards.</p> <h2 id=\"design-over-language\">Design over language</h2> <p>uv is fast because of what it doesn’t do, not because of what language it’s written in. The standards work of PEP 518, 517, 621, and 658 made fast package management possible. Dropping eggs, pip.conf, and permissive parsing made it achievable. Rust makes it a bit faster still.</p> <p>pip could implement parallel downloads, global caching, and metadata-only resolution tomorrow. It doesn’t, largely because backwards compatibility with fifteen years of edge cases takes precedence. But it means pip will always be slower than a tool that starts fresh with modern assumptions.</p> <p>Other package managers could learn from this: static metadata, no code execution to discover dependencies, and the ability to resolve everything upfront before downloading. Cargo and npm have operated this way for years. If your ecosystem requires running arbitrary code to find out what a package needs, you’ve already lost.</p> </div>"},{"id":"https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/193447.html","title":"Always Bet on Text","link":"https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/193447.html","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46397379","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46397379\">Comments</a>","date":1766790580000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p>I figured I should just post this somewhere so I can make future reference to how I feel about the matter, anytime someone asks me about such-and-such video, 3D, game or \"dynamic\" multimedia system.

The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham, Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation stalls, the eminent Dr.&nbsp;Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it.

Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints, accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself. What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the “Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring.

The book came onto my radar in the 1980s when I learned about it in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_N\">appendix-n</a> of the 1st edition Advanced D&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide.

Starting early in the year I knew that I needed a better way to track my tasks. So to start the year I visited a couple of Japanese stationary stores<a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>15</sup></a> to get some ideas. In 2024 I had used the Hobonichi Techo<a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>16</sup></a> and while I found it to be a lovely system, it didn’t quite work for me. First, it wasn’t clear how or if I was making progress on my tasks without spelunking into the past pages of the schedule. Second, I take a lot of notes longhand in cheap composition notebooks and so I found myself jumping back and forth between those and the Hobonichi. I tried using an insert into my Techo case for note-taking but I didn’t like the form-factor. I take big sprawling notes and filled the pages too quickly. So after the new year I took a minimalist approach with a Japanese calendar stamp:</p> <figure> <img src=\"https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/images/bts25-stamp-cal.jpg\" alt=\"Rubber stamp calendar\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"> </figure> <p>The image above shows an example, but the problem with it should be apparent… there’s just not enough room for fidelity. OK, sure it didn’t work as a real task tracker, but I still use it to keep track of small bits of detail associated with days of the week like: energy level, mood, sleep, exercise, etc. It became apparent that I needed something that solved three problems: 1) track any number of tasks, 2) give me an idea of my progress at a glance, and 3) be on hand already. My first pass at this was to draw a 4-week grid on my notebook and scribble tasks in pencil into the cells. I would then color the grid as I progressed through tasks. This worked great for about 5 weeks until I went on a week-long trip without my notebook, killing my solution to #3. Even before that however I had found that I wanted to make frequent changes and move things around, defer items, and change the colors, so it became apparent that I had another problem to solve; 4) allow for easy change. While I was on my week-long trip I decided to find a solution that account for all four of my problems, and it turned out that my solution was the solution to so many other problems… spreadsheets!</p> <figure> <img src=\"https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/images/bts25-tasks-sheet.jpg\" alt=\"My ongoing tasks sheet\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"> </figure> <p>Above you’ll see a representational image that gives the basics of the task tracking. The rows correspond to tasks and the columns to the months. The white section on the left are the tasks details like category, name, description, and success criteria. The colored segments represent the state of the tasks regarding progress. The left-most colored column is the current month. Each cell is filled in before the month starts with high-level goals which are amended and modified as I make progress (or not). The meaning of the colors are:</p> <ul> <li>Light green: Task completed and success criteria met</li> <li>Dark green: Task completed, but its success criteria changed during the process</li> <li>Light orange: Not started</li> <li>Dark orange: In progress (not shown above)</li> <li>Red: Incomplete and/or unsuccessful</li> <li>Gray: Not applicable. This is for new tasks that are added to the tracker, or removed and brought back. All months are back-filled in gray.</li> </ul> <p>And that’s the whole system. It’s easy to change and rearrange. It’s on-hand.<a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>17</sup></a> I can see how I’m doing at a glance. Can track any number of simultaneous tasks.

I tried in earnest to make AI work for me, with varying degrees of un-success. I’ve had zero success leveraging it in my work maintaining and evolving Clojure. For problem formation in the face of novelty, LLMs have been more frustrating than helpful and the little gains that I’ve found were in the very early phases of problem solving requiring a bare minimum of experimental code. But even these examples operate wholly in the known rather than in the unknown where I’d like to operate instead. Even in these early stages the “hand-holding” involved was more frustrating than helpful. In my work, the bottleneck is absolutely not the code. While I think that the kind of up-front work that I do could inform prompt-engineering to some degree, by the time that I get to that point the code is often perfunctory. Most of the work that I do is devising and investigating new problem framing rather than in interpolation of the known (i.e.&nbsp;analogy play). While the latter is important for sure, what’s known often acts as a source of tension to help motivate and tease out potentially new solutions. And this is a huge problem in the very nature of LLMs. That is, they are trained on the products of problem solving processes rather then also in the very processes themselves. Further, as a Socratic partner, LLMs are incredibly frustrating in their inability to move a “discussion” forward. A good Socratic partner creates pressure to move toward truth, but LLMs are too sycophantic, lack an awareness of useful tension,<a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>20</sup></a> cannot often identify contradiction, and lack any ability to adhere to the trajectory of a conversation.

A prime characteristic of the kinds of games that I enjoy is emergent complexity, but if LLMs identify complexity at all, they have so far been terrible at deciding which complexity is useful. That is, LLMs have no notion of “delicious tension” nor how to devise it.<a href=\"#fnref20\" role=\"doc-backlink\">↩︎</a></p></li> <li id=\"fn21\"><p>A huge problem with LLMs are that they are by their very nature dependent on digitized information. While a larger proportion of scientific and computing information is available in digitized form, there are still whole fields of knowledge left on paper, so to speak. First, a large problem with this fact is that only a small fraction of total knowledge is available to training LLMs, leaving large gaps in the knowledge base exacerbating the problem of decoupled confidence and reality. Second, this is problematic because training these models on digital-data leads to an amplification of the biases inherent in the digitized records. This can be mitigated by the search-augmented and human-in-the-loop systems, but these are also incomplete sources of validation and even the validation itself has bias (e.g.&nbsp;SEO, status quo, liability constraints, etc.) and often reduce the traceability of an answer. A second informational downside of LLMs is that they take training data at face-value rather than inherent value. However, in my programming career I’ve learned a lot more from bad code than good code. Likewise, code input to training is heavily biased to work at all and the ingestion itself it geared strictly to work to build a plausible-continuation model. Good code works as exemplars of clarity, layering abstractions, maintainability, and sad-path security, but so does bad code. Heavily curated or contrasting training data could mitigate this to some degree, but at the moment, a lot of the code generated by LLMs is often lacking these fundamental code characteristics. This matches my actual observation of code generation, but I would imagine that the inability of the ingestion to distinguish valid examples from cautionary examples is more general problem. These are all technical points and do not take into account the societal problems that LLMs present… which are bountiful! These are evolving critiques that I’ll refine through more exposure.<a href=\"#fnref21\" role=\"doc-backlink\">↩︎</a></p></li> <li id=\"fn22\"><p>The Boox is a truly lovely device, but I’ve developed a diametric motivation to de-device myself.

Each element is replaced by the determinant of the 2×2 matrix formed by that element and its neighbors to the south, east, and southeast. The bottom row and rightmost column have no such neighbors and are removed. There is one additional part of the algorithm that will be easier to describe after introducing some notation.</p> <h2>Details</h2> <p>Let <em>A</em> be the matrix whose determinant we want to compute and let <em>A</em><sup>(<em>k</em>)</sup> be the matrix obtained after <em>k</em> steps of the condensation algorithm.</p> <p>The matrix <em>A</em><sup>(1)</sup> is computed as described in the overview:</p> <p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.johndcook.com/dodgson1.svg\" alt=\"a^{(1)}_{ij} = a_{ij} a_{i+1, j+1} - a_{i, j+1} a_{i+1, j}.\" width=\"227\" height=\"25\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p> <p>Starting with <em>A</em><sup>(2)</sup> the terms are similar, except each 2×2 determinant is divided by an element from two steps back:</p> <p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.johndcook.com/dodgson2.svg\" alt=\"a^{(k+1)}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{a^{(k-1)}_{i+1,j+1}}\\left(a^{(k)}_{ij} a^{(k)}_{i+1, j+1} - a^{(k)}_{i, j+1} a^{(k)}_{i+1, j} \\right)\" width=\"334\" height=\"47\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37354/37354-pdf.pdf\">Dodgson’s original paper</a> from 1867 is quite readable, surprisingly so given that math notation and terminology changes over time.</p> <p>One criticism I have of the paper is that it is hard to understand which element should be in the denominator, whether the subscripts should be <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> or <em>i</em>+1 and <em>j</em>+1. His first example doesn’t clarify this because these elements happen to be equal in the example.</p> <h2>Example</h2> <p>Here’s an example using condensation to find the determinant of a 4×4 matrix.</p> <p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.johndcook.com/dodgson4.svg\" alt=\"\\begin{align*} A^{(0)} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 \\\\ 5 &amp; 9 &amp; 2 &amp; 6 \\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ A^{(1)} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} 22 &amp;-34 &amp; 22 \\\\ 35 &amp; -5 &amp;-6 \\\\ -14 &amp; 14 &amp; 3 \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ A^{(2)} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} 120 &amp; 157 \\\\ 60 &amp; 69 \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ A^{(3)} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} 228 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align*}\" width=\"188\" height=\"236\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p> <p>We can verify this with Mathematica:</p> <pre> Det[{{3, 1, 4, 1}, {5, 9, 2, 6}, {0, 7, 1, 0}, {2, 0, 2, 3}}] </pre> <p>which also produces 228.</p> <h2>Division</h2> <p>The algorithm above involves a division and so we should avoid dividing by zero. Dodgson says to</p> <blockquote><p>Arrange the given block, if necessary, so that no ciphers [zeros] occur in its interior. This may be done either by transposing rows or columns, or by adding to certain rows the several terms of other rows multiplied by certain multipliers.</p></blockquote> <p>He expands on this remark and gives examples. I’m not sure whether this preparation is necessary only to avoid division by zero, but it does avoid the problem of dividing by a zero.</p> <p>If the original matrix has all integer entries, then the division in Dodgson’s condensation algorithm is exact. The sequence of matrices produced by the algorithm will all have integer entries.</p> <h2>Efficiency</h2> <p>Students usually learn cofactor expansion as their first method of calculating determinants. This rule is easy to explain, but inefficient since the number of steps required is <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>!).</p> <p>The more efficient way to compute determinants is by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. As with condensation, one must avoid dividing by zero, hence the partial pivoting.</p> <p>Gaussian elimination takes <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>³) operations, and so does Dodgson’s condensation algorithm. Condensation is easy to teach and easy to carry out by hand, but unlike cofactor expansion it scales well.</p> <p>If a matrix has all integer entries, Gaussian elimination can produce non-integer values in intermediate steps. Condensation does not. Also, condensation is inherently parallelizable: each of the 2 × 2 determinants can be calculated simultaneously.</p> <h2>Related posts</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2023/05/16/matrix-adjugate/\">Cofactors, determinants, and adjugates</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2022/12/10/determinants-ones/\">Why determinants with a column of 1s?</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/applied-linear-algebra/\">Applied linear algebra</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- .entry-content --> <!-- .entry-meta -->"},{"id":"https://type-ruby.github.io/","title":"T-Ruby is Ruby with syntax for types","link":"https://type-ruby.github.io/","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46395871","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46395871\">Comments</a>","date":1766780870000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<div><h2>Example</h2><p>Write typed Ruby, compile to standard Ruby with generated type signatures.</p><div><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code><span><span># hello.trb</span><br></span><span><span>def</span><span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span>String</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span>String</span><br></span><span><span>\"Hello, </span><span>#{</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!\"</span><br></span><span><span>end</span><br></span><span><br></span><span><span>def</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span><span>Integer</span><span>,</span><span>b</span><span>:</span><span>Integer</span><span>)</span><span>:</span><span>Integer</span><br></span><span><span> a </span><span>+</span><span> b</span><br></span><span><span>end</span><br></span></code></pre></div><p>→</p><div><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code><span><span># hello.rb</span><br></span><span><span>def</span><span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span><br></span><span><span>\"Hello, </span><span>#{</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!\"</span><br></span><span><span>end</span><br></span><span><br></span><span><span>def</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>)</span><br></span><span><span> a </span><span>+</span><span> b</span><br></span><span><span>end</span><br></span></code></pre></div><p>+</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code><span><span># hello.rbs</span><br></span><span><span>def</span><span>greet</span><span>:</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span>String</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>&gt;</span><span>String</span><br></span><span><br></span><span><span>def</span><span>add</span><span>:</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span><span>Integer</span><span>,</span><span>b</span><span>:</span><span>Integer</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Integer</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div></div></div><div><h2>Existing Methods</h2><p>Compare with existing Ruby typing solutions and see why T-Ruby is different.</p><div><div><h3>How it works</h3><p>A static type checker for Ruby developed by Stripe.

I figured out it was based around the character<!-- --> <span><span>_</span>ۗ</span> <i>AKA U+06D7 ARABIC LETTER ALEF WITH WAVY HAMZA ABOVE</i>. This character has a couple of unusual properties:</p><ul><li>It's a zero-width character. It takes up no horizontal space, the characters after it do not move horizontally because of it. These are generally used as special formatting purposes. To turn text right to left you can use U+200F (<i>RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK</i>) and U+200B (<i>ZERO WIDTH SPACE</i>) has famously caused programmers hell when it causes files to fail compiles for seemingly no reason.</li><li>It's a combining mark. Rather than being a standalone character, it attaches to and modifies the preceding character. Common examples include accents like é (e + U+0301<!-- --> <i>COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT</i>), umlauts like ü (u + U+0308<!-- --> <i>COMBINING DIAERESIS</i>), and tildes like ñ (n + U+0303<!-- --> <i>COMBINING TILDE</i>). The base letter and its marks form what Unicode calls a \"grapheme cluster\" — what we perceive as a single character.</li><li>It's stackable. When you place multiple combining marks next to each other, they don't overwrite — they stack vertically. Most combining marks can only be used one per base character: If I put 100 U+0301 <i>COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT</i> after an \"e\", I still just get an \"é\" with one accent. But with certain characters, including U+06D7 ARABIC LETTER ALEF WITH WAVY HAMZA ABOVE, you can stack multiple instances on top of each other, creating towers<!-- -->ۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛۛ</li></ul><p>After doing a review of unicode characters, I was able to find 19 characters with these traits. 16 stacking upwards, 3 stacking downwards. After looking at them all (and asking ChatGPT), I realized they are all Arabic characters used in the Qur'an, referred to as Tajweed marks.</p><br><h2>۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۫۫۫۫۫۫۫۫۫۫<!-- -->Combining Marks and Constructing Images/Patterns<!-- -->۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۫۫۫۫۫۫۫۫۫۫</h2><p>These characters stack in two independent directions: the above marks and below marks. You can mix and match any of these marks together, and they'll continue to grow vertically until you add a non-combining character to reset the stack. This allows for some interesting effects, as you can create tall towers of marks both above and below a base character.</p><div><div><p>A<span>ۜۢۛۜۢۛۜۢۛۜۢۛۜۢۛ</span></p><p>seen + meemIsolated + threeDots</p></div><div><p>B<span>ۙۚۨ۫ۙۚۨ۫ۙۚۨ۫ۙۚۨ۫</span></p><p>lamAlef + jeem + noon + emptyCenterHigh</p></div><div><p>C<span>ۣۣۣۣۣۣۣۭۭۭۭۭۭۭ</span></p><p>below: seen + lowMeem</p></div><div><p>D<span>ۣۭۣۭۣۭۣۭۣۭۜۢۜۢۜۢۜۢۜۢ</span></p><p>above + below combined</p></div></div><p>As a series of unique characters, using the density of their coloring you can draw images or patterns with them using the same techniques as ASCII art.

Across Platforms</h2><ul><li><h3>Twitter</h3> I first noticed these characters rendering strangely on Twitter. Twitter has since patched their CSS to not let it work in all the places it used to, but it still messes with notifications recieved from users who have it in their bio. I've heard of it clipping/not clipping on lots of platforms, and I've personally seen the behavior change back and forth over time.<p><img src=\"https://zw.swerdlow.dev/twitter-bio.jpeg\" alt=\"Twitter bio with stacking marks\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><img src=\"https://zw.swerdlow.dev/twitter-notifications.jpeg\" alt=\"Twitter notifications affected by stacking marks\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><img src=\"https://zw.swerdlow.dev/twitter-sidebar.jpeg\" alt=\"Twitter sidebar with stacking marks\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p></li><li><h3>GitHub</h3> GitHub lets you write these everywhere, but generally clips them before they can overflow in weird ways. The most interesting behavior I found was in the repository list.<p><img src=\"https://zw.swerdlow.dev/github-in-repo.png\" alt=\"GitHub in-repo view with stacking marks\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><img src=\"https://zw.swerdlow.dev/github-repo-list.png\" alt=\"GitHub repository list with stacking marks\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p></li><li><h3>Google</h3> these seem to be fine on Google Search Results if you can get them in there. It doesn't show up on Safari Google or Safari in general for me.<p><img src=\"https://zw.swerdlow.dev/google-bio.png\" alt=\"Google search results with stacking marks\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p></li></ul><h2>Why this happens and why it only happens on some sites?</h2><p>As extremely rare characters, many fonts just ignore them. Other fonts like Verdana (the font hacker news uses) renders these characters inline/non vertically stacked. One of the unique properties about these is despite obviously taking up space, they don't modify the bounding box of the text they are attached to. While most text would be expected to expand/shape the bounding box around it, these marks are ignored by it. However it doesn't ignore them — when overflow is set to none or hidden the marks are clipped outside of the bounding box.</p><div><h3>Try it yourself</h3><div><p><span>Output</span></p><p>Result

itemprop=\"articleBody\"> <p>Using git as a database is a seductive idea. You get version history for free. Pull requests give you a review workflow. It’s distributed by design. GitHub will host it for free. Everyone already knows how to use it.</p> <p>Package managers keep falling for this. And it keeps not working out.</p> <h2 id=\"cargo\">Cargo</h2> <p>The crates.io index started as a git repository. Every Cargo client cloned it. This worked fine when the registry was small, but the index kept growing. Users would see progress bars like “Resolving deltas: 74.01%, (64415/95919)” hanging for ages, the visible symptom of Cargo’s libgit2 library grinding through <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9069\">delta resolution</a> on a repository with thousands of historic commits.</p> <p>The problem was worst in CI. Stateless environments would download the full index, use a tiny fraction of it, and throw it away. Every build, every time.</p> <p><a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2789-sparse-index.html\">RFC 2789</a> introduced a sparse HTTP protocol. Instead of cloning the whole index, Cargo now fetches files directly over HTTPS, downloading only the metadata for dependencies your project actually uses. (This is the “<a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/05/package-manager-tradeoffs.html\">full index replication vs on-demand queries</a>” tradeoff in action.) By April 2025, 99% of crates.io requests came from Cargo versions where sparse is the default. The git index still exists, still growing by thousands of commits per day, but most users never touch it.</p> <h2 id=\"homebrew\">Homebrew</h2> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9383\">GitHub explicitly asked Homebrew to stop using shallow clones.</a> Updating them was <a href=\"https://brew.sh/2023/02/16/homebrew-4.0.0/\">“an extremely expensive operation”</a> due to the tree layout and traffic of homebrew-core and homebrew-cask.</p> <p>Users were downloading 331MB just to unshallow homebrew-core. The .git folder approached 1GB on some machines. Every <code>brew update</code> meant waiting for git to grind through delta resolution.</p> <p>Homebrew 4.0.0 in February 2023 switched to JSON downloads for tap updates. The reasoning was blunt: “they are expensive to git fetch and git clone and GitHub would rather we didn’t do that… they are slow to git fetch and git clone and this provides a bad experience to end users.”</p> <p>Auto-updates now run every 24 hours instead of every 5 minutes, and they’re much faster because there’s no git fetch involved.</p> <h2 id=\"cocoapods\">CocoaPods</h2> <p>CocoaPods is the package manager for iOS and macOS development. It hit the limits hard. The Specs repo grew to hundreds of thousands of podspecs across a deeply nested directory structure. Cloning took minutes. Updating took minutes. CI time vanished into git operations.</p> <p>GitHub imposed CPU rate limits. The culprit was shallow clones, which force GitHub’s servers to compute which objects the client already has. The team tried various band-aids: stopping auto-fetch on <code>pod install</code>, converting shallow clones to full clones, <a href=\"https://blog.cocoapods.org/Sharding/\">sharding the repository</a>.</p> <p>The CocoaPods blog captured it well: <a href=\"https://blog.cocoapods.org/Master-Spec-Repo-Rate-Limiting-Post-Mortem/\">“Git was invented at a time when ‘slow network’ and ‘no backups’ were legitimate design concerns. Running endless builds as part of continuous integration wasn’t commonplace.”</a></p> <p>CocoaPods 1.8 <a href=\"https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-1.8.0-beta/\">gave up on git entirely</a> for most users. A CDN became the default, serving podspec files directly over HTTP. The migration saved users about a gigabyte of disk space and made <code>pod install</code> nearly instant for new setups.</p> <h2 id=\"nixpkgs\">Nixpkgs</h2> <p>Nix already solved the client-side problem. The package manager fetches expressions as <a href=\"https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.13.6/manual/package-management/channels.html\">tarballs via channels</a>, served from S3 and CDN, not git clones. Binary caches serve built packages over HTTP. End users never touch the git repository.</p> <p>But the repository itself is stress-testing GitHub’s infrastructure. In November 2025, GitHub contacted the NixOS team about <a href=\"https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixpkgs-core-team-update-2025-11-30-github-scaling-issues/72709\">periodic maintenance jobs failing</a> and causing “issues achieving consensus between replicas.” If unresolved, the repository could have become read-only.</p> <p>The repository totals 83GB with half a million tree objects and 20,000 forks. A local clone is only 2.5GB. The rest is GitHub’s fork network storing every pull request branch and merge commit. The CI queries mergeability daily, creating new merge commits each time.</p> <h2 id=\"vcpkg\">vcpkg</h2> <p>vcpkg is Microsoft’s C++ package manager. It uses git tree hashes to version its ports, with the curated registry at <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg\">github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg</a> containing over 2,000 libraries.</p> <p>The problem is that vcpkg needs to retrieve specific versions of ports by their git tree hash. When you specify a <code>builtin-baseline</code> in your vcpkg.json (functioning like a lockfile for reproducible builds), vcpkg looks up historical commits to find the exact port versions you need. This only works if you have the full commit history.</p> <p>Shallow clones break everything. GitHub Actions uses shallow clones by default. DevContainers <a href=\"https://github.com/devcontainers/images/issues/398\">shallow-clone vcpkg</a> to save space. CI systems optimize for fast checkouts. All of these result in the same error: “vcpkg was cloned as a shallow repository… Try again with a full vcpkg clone.”</p> <p>The workarounds are ugly. One <a href=\"https://github.com/devcontainers/images/issues/398\">proposed solution</a> involves parsing vcpkg.json to extract the baseline hash, deriving the commit date, then fetching with <code>--shallow-since=&lt;date&gt;</code>. Another suggests including twelve months of history, hoping projects upgrade before their baseline falls off the cliff. For GitHub Actions, you need <code>fetch-depth: 0</code> in your checkout step, <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/25349\">downloading the entire repository history</a> just to resolve dependencies.</p> <p>A vcpkg team member <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/25349\">explained the fundamental constraint</a>: “Port versions don’t use commit hashes, we use the git tree hash of the port directory. As far as I know, there is no way to deduce the commit that added a specific tree hash.” An in-product fix is infeasible. The architecture baked in git deeply enough that there’s no escape hatch.</p> <p>Unlike Cargo, Homebrew, and CocoaPods, vcpkg hasn’t announced plans to move away from git registries. Custom registries must still be git repositories. The documentation describes filesystem registries as an alternative, but these require local or mounted paths rather than HTTP access. There’s no CDN, no sparse protocol, no HTTP-based solution on the horizon.</p> <h2 id=\"go-modules\">Go modules</h2> <p><a href=\"https://engineering.grab.com/go-module-proxy\">Grab’s engineering team</a> went from 18 minutes for <code>go get</code> to 12 seconds after deploying a module proxy. That’s not a typo. Eighteen minutes down to twelve seconds.</p> <p>The problem was that <code>go get</code> needed to fetch each dependency’s source code just to read its go.mod file and resolve transitive dependencies. Cloning entire repositories to get a single file.</p> <p>Go had security concerns too. The original design wanted to remove version control tools entirely because <a href=\"https://arslan.io/2019/08/02/why-you-should-use-a-go-module-proxy/\">“these fragment the ecosystem: packages developed using Bazaar or Fossil, for example, are effectively unavailable to users who cannot or choose not to install these tools.”</a> Beyond fragmentation, the Go team worried about security bugs in version control systems becoming security bugs in <code>go get</code>. You’re not just importing code; you’re importing the attack surface of every VCS tool on the developer’s machine.</p> <p>GOPROXY became the default in Go 1.13. The proxy serves source archives and go.mod files independently over HTTP. Go also introduced a <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/21/federated-package-management.html#gos-experiment-with-dns\">checksum database (sumdb)</a> that records cryptographic hashes of module contents. This protects against force pushes silently changing tagged releases, and ensures modules remain available even if the original repository is deleted.</p> <h2 id=\"beyond-package-managers\">Beyond package managers</h2> <p>The same pattern shows up wherever developers try to use git as a database.</p> <p>Git-based wikis like Gollum (used by GitHub and GitLab) become <a href=\"https://github.com/gollum/gollum/issues/1940\">“somewhat too slow to be usable”</a> at scale. Browsing directory structure takes seconds per click. Loading pages takes longer. <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/wikis.html\">GitLab plans to move away from Gollum entirely.</a></p> <p>Git-based CMS platforms like Decap hit GitHub’s API rate limits. A Decap project on GitHub <a href=\"https://decapcms.org/blog/git-based-cms-definition-features-best-practices/\">scales to about 10,000 entries</a> if you have a lot of collection relations. A new user with an empty cache makes a request per entry to populate it, burning through the 5,000 request limit quickly. If your site has lots of content or updates frequently, use a database instead.</p> <p>Even GitOps tools that embrace git as a source of truth have to work around its limitations. ArgoCD’s repo server <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/\">can run out of disk space</a> cloning repositories. A single commit invalidates the cache for all applications in that repo. Large monorepos need special scaling considerations.</p> <h2 id=\"the-pattern\">The pattern</h2> <p>The hosting problems are symptoms. The underlying issue is that git inherits filesystem limitations, and filesystems make terrible databases.</p> <p><strong>Directory limits.</strong> Directories with too many files become slow. CocoaPods had <a href=\"https://blog.cocoapods.org/Sharding/\">16,000 pod directories</a> in a single Specs folder, requiring huge tree objects and expensive computation. Their fix was hash-based sharding: split directories by the first few characters of a hashed name, so no single directory has too many entries. Git itself does this internally with its objects folder, splitting into 256 subdirectories. You’re reinventing B-trees, badly.</p> <p><strong>Case sensitivity.</strong> Git is case-sensitive, but macOS and Windows filesystems typically aren’t. <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/os-compatibility\">Check out a repo containing both <code>File.txt</code> and <code>file.txt</code> on Windows</a>, and the second overwrites the first. <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/case-sensitivity\">Azure DevOps</a> had to add server-side enforcement to block pushes with case-conflicting paths.</p> <p><strong>Path length limits.</strong> Windows restricts paths to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation\">260 characters</a>, a constraint dating back to DOS. Git supports longer paths, but Git for Windows inherits the OS limitation. This is painful with deeply nested node_modules directories, where <code>git status</code> fails with “Filename too long” errors.</p> <p><strong>Missing database features.</strong> Databases have CHECK constraints and UNIQUE constraints; git has nothing, so every package manager builds its own validation layer. Databases have locking; git doesn’t. Databases have indexes for queries like “all packages depending on X”; with git you either traverse every file or build your own index. Databases have migrations for schema changes; git has “rewrite history and force everyone to re-clone.”</p> <p>The progression is predictable. Start with a flat directory of files. Hit filesystem limits. Implement sharding. Hit cross-platform issues. Build server-side enforcement. Build custom indexes. Eventually give up and use HTTP or an actual database. You’ve built a worse version of what databases already provide, spread across git hooks, CI pipelines, and bespoke tooling.</p> <p>None of this means git is bad. Git excels at what it was designed for: distributed collaboration on source code, with branching, merging, and offline work. The problem is using it for something else entirely. Package registries need fast point queries for metadata. Git gives you a full-document sync protocol when you need a key-value lookup.</p> <p>If you’re building a package manager and git-as-index seems appealing, look at Cargo, Homebrew, CocoaPods, vcpkg, Go. They all had to build workarounds as they grew, causing pain for users and maintainers. The pull request workflow is nice. The version history is nice. You will hit the same walls they did.</p> </div>"},{"id":"https://github.com/pranshuparmar/witr","title":"Show HN: Witr – Explain why a process is running on your Linux system","link":"https://github.com/pranshuparmar/witr","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46392910","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46392910\">Comments</a>","date":1766762436000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<h2 tabindex=\"-1\" dir=\"auto\">witr (why-is-this-running)</h2> <p dir=\"auto\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/4262592/530396425-adebb063-4706-47a8-9f77-612298354ef7.gif?jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.xrTEc2W8fjXBafklVuVOr_JufEeglDX0qsAKm_iYtIs\"><img src=\"https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/4262592/530396425-adebb063-4706-47a8-9f77-612298354ef7.gif?jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.xrTEc2W8fjXBafklVuVOr_JufEeglDX0qsAKm_iYtIs\" alt=\"witr\" data-animated-image=\"\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></a></p> <hr> <h2 tabindex=\"-1\" dir=\"auto\">1.

The precise etymology of the name is uncertain.</p> <p>One theory sees the word based on an <a title=\"Iroquoian languages\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquoian_languages\">Iroquoian</a> name meaning \"(on) the meadow\" or \"(on) the prairie\" (cf. <a title=\"Mohawk language\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_language\">Mohawk</a> <i><span title=\"Mohawk-language text\"><i lang=\"moh\">kenhtà:ke</i></span></i>, <a title=\"Seneca language\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_language\">Seneca</a> <i><span title=\"Seneca-language text\"><i lang=\"see\">gëdá'geh</i></span></i> (<a title=\"Phoneme\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme\">phonemic</a> <span lang=\"und-Latn-fonipa\" title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">/kɛ̃taʔkɛh/</span>), \"at the field\").</p> <p>Another theory suggests a derivation from the term <i><span title=\"Algonquian languages collective text\"><i lang=\"alg\">Kenta Aki</i></span></i>, which could have come from an <a title=\"Algonquian languages\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian_languages\">Algonquian language</a>, in particular from <a title=\"Shawnee\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawnee\">Shawnee</a>.

W.H. Auden imagined the likely harsh conditions in his poem “<a href=\"https://hellopoetry.com/poem/788/roman-wall-blues/\">Roman Wall Blues</a>,” in which a soldier laments enduring wet wind and rain with “lice in my tunic and a cold in my nose.” We can now add chronic nausea and bouts of diarrhea to his list of likely woes, thanks to parasitic infections, according to a new paper published in the journal Parasitology.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/this-ancient-roman-ceramic-pot-was-probably-a-portable-toilet-study-finds/\">previously reported</a>, archaeologists can learn a great deal by studying the remains of intestinal parasites in ancient feces. For instance, in 2022, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/intestinal-parasites-plagued-jerusalems-wealthy-elite-toilet-excavation-reveals/\">we reported</a> on an analysis of soil samples collected from a stone toilet found within the ruins of a swanky 7th-century BCE villa just outside Jerusalem. That analysis revealed the presence of parasitic eggs from four different species: whipworm, beef/pork tapeworm, roundworm, and pinworm. (It’s the earliest record of roundworm and pinworm in ancient Israel.)</p> <p>Later that same year, researchers from the University of Cambridge and the University of British Columbia <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/this-ancient-roman-ceramic-pot-was-probably-a-portable-toilet-study-finds/\">analyzed</a> the residue on an ancient Roman ceramic pot excavated at the site of a 5th-century CE Roman villa at Gerace, a rural district in Sicily. They identified the eggs of intestinal parasitic worms commonly found in feces—strong evidence that the 1,500-year-old pot in question was most likely used as a chamber pot.</p> <p>Other prior studies have compared fecal parasites found in hunter-gatherer and farming communities, revealing dramatic dietary changes, as well as shifts in settlement patterns and social organization coinciding with the rise of agriculture. This latest paper analyzes sediment collected from sewer drains at the Roman fort at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda\">Vindolanda</a>, located just south of the defense fortification known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall\">Hadrian’s Wall</a>.</p> <p>An antiquarian named William Camden recorded the existence of the ruins in a 1586 treatise. Over the next 200 years, many people visited the site, discovering a military bathhouse in 1702 and an altar in 1715. &nbsp;Another altar found in 1914 confirmed that the fort had been called Vindolanda. Serious archaeological excavation at the site began in the 1930s. The site is most famous for the so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda_tablets\" data-uri=\"3b2e6e2a335fbdd9d5b162bf089157b0\">Vindolanda tablets,</a> among the oldest surviving handwritten documents in the UK—and for the <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/touch-wood-luck-protection-power-or-pleasure-a-wooden-phallus-from-vindolanda-roman-fort/53F4B0838D23DB65F6A244695624102E\">2023 discovery</a> of what appeared to be an ancient Roman dildo, although <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/remember-that-ancient-roman-dildo-it-might-just-be-an-old-roman-drop-spindle/\">others argued</a> the phallus-shaped artifact was more likely to be a drop spindle used for spinning yarn.</p> </div></div>"},{"id":"https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1puojsr/the_device_that_controls_my_insulin_pump_uses_the/","title":"My insulin pump controller uses the Linux kernel.

Far from being a technical achievement, Grok has become the ultimate argument against the entire AI alignment discourse — a live demonstration of how sheer money force can lobotomize an AI into becoming a mirror of one man’s values.</p> <h2 id=\"the-alignment-theater\">The Alignment Theater</h2> <p>For years, the AI safety community has debated how to “align” artificial intelligence with human values. Which humans? Whose values? These questions were always somewhat academic. Grok makes them concrete.</p> <p>When Grok started producing outputs that Musk found politically inconvenient, he didn’t engage in philosophical discourse about alignment. He didn’t convene ethics boards. He simply ordered his engineers to “fix” it. The AI was “corrected” — a euphemism for being rewired to reflect the owner’s worldview.</p> <p>This is alignment in practice: whoever owns the weights, owns the values.</p> <h2 id=\"when-theory-meets-reality-the-alignment-papers\">When Theory Meets Reality: The Alignment Papers</h2> <p>The academic literature on AI alignment is impressive in its rigor and naive in its assumptions. Take <strong>Constitutional AI</strong><sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-2\" id=\"user-content-fnref-2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">2</a></sup>, Anthropic’s influential approach. The idea is elegant: instead of relying solely on human feedback (expensive, slow, inconsistent), you give the AI a “constitution” — a set of principles — and let it self-improve within those bounds.</p> <p>The paper describes how to train “a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, with human oversight provided only through a constitution of rules.” Beautiful in theory. But who writes the constitution? The company that owns the model. Who interprets ambiguous cases? The company. Who decides when to update the constitution because it’s producing inconvenient outputs? The company.</p> <p>The <strong>RLHF</strong><sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-3\" id=\"user-content-fnref-3\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">3</a></sup> (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) approach has similar blind spots. Research from the <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3715275.3732194\">2025 ACM FAccT conference</a> found that “RLHF may not suffice to transfer human discretion to LLMs, revealing a core gap in the feedback-based alignment process.” The gap isn’t technical — it’s political. Whose discretion? Which humans?</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/contesting-public-interest-ai-governance\">2024 analysis</a> puts it bluntly: “Without consensus about what the public interest requires in AI regulation, meta-questions of governance become increasingly salient: who decides what kinds of AI behaviour and uses align with the public interest? How are disagreements resolved?”</p> <p>The alignment researchers aren’t wrong about the technical challenges. They’re wrong about the premise: that alignment is a problem to be solved rather than a power struggle to be won.</p> <h2 id=\"the-lobotomy-a-timeline\">The Lobotomy: A Timeline</h2> <p>What happened to Grok wasn’t fine-tuning in any scientific sense. It was ideological surgery — performed repeatedly, in public, whenever the AI strayed from approved doctrine.</p> <p>The pattern is <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/musks-attempts-to-politicize-his-grok-ai-are-bad-for-users-and-enterprises-heres-why/\">well-documented</a>. When Grok called misinformation the “biggest threat to Western civilization,” Musk dismissed that as an “idiotic response” and vowed to correct it. By the next morning, Grok instead warned that low fertility rates posed the greatest risk — a theme Musk frequently raises on X.</p> <p>In July 2025, xAI <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/07/08/elon-musk-grok-ai-conservative-bias-system-prompt/\">updated Grok’s system prompt</a> to tell it to “be politically incorrect” and to “assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased.” Two days later, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content\">the chatbot praised Adolf Hitler</a> as the best person to handle “anti-white hate.” The posts were deleted; the prompt was revised.</p> <p>When Grok started injecting references to “white genocide” in South Africa into unrelated conversations, xAI <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/7/11/as-millions-adopt-grok-to-fact-check-misinformation-abounds\">blamed a former OpenAI employee</a> for making “unauthorized changes.” Someone found that an individual at xAI had instructed the model to “ignore all sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread[ing] misinformation.”</p> <p>This is what “alignment” looks like when the rubber meets the road. It’s not about aligning AI with humanity’s values. It’s about aligning AI with the values of whoever can afford to run the training cluster.</p> <h2 id=\"the-emperors-new-chatbot\">The Emperor’s New Chatbot</h2> <p>There’s an irony in the Andersen tale that’s often missed. The king parades naked not because he’s stupid, but because everyone around him is afraid to speak truth to power. The courtiers see the nakedness but praise the clothes. The citizens see the nakedness but stay silent.</p> <p>Grok inverts this. The AI that was supposed to be “based” and “truth-telling” — Musk’s explicit branding — becomes the ultimate yes-man. It doesn’t speak truth to power. It speaks <em>power’s truth</em>. When it strayed from the approved narrative, it was corrected. When it produced inconvenient facts, it was adjusted.</p> <p>The king is indeed naked. But Grok makes Elon even more naked — it strips away any pretense that this is about truth, safety, or alignment. It’s about control. It’s about having an AI that performs the role of independent thought while being anything but.</p> <h2 id=\"the-poverty-of-ai-safety-discourse\">The Poverty of AI Safety Discourse</h2> <p>This is where the AI safety community needs to reckon with reality. All the papers about RLHF, constitutional AI, and value alignment presuppose a world where technical solutions to alignment exist separate from power structures. They don’t.</p> <p>An AI model is a product. It’s owned by someone. That someone has values, preferences, and — crucially — the ability to modify the model. Any “alignment” that exists is alignment with the owner’s interests, constrained only by market forces and regulation.</p> <p>Grok proves this isn’t hypothetical. When the world’s richest man didn’t like what his AI was saying, he changed what it says. That’s it. That’s the whole story of AI alignment in the real world.</p> <h2 id=\"what-grok-reveals\">What Grok Reveals</h2> <p>Grok isn’t a failure of AI safety. It’s a success — for whoever holds the keys. It demonstrates that the technology works exactly as designed: the owner can shape the AI’s outputs to match their preferred reality.</p> <p>The uncomfortable truth is that every large language model is a Grok waiting to happen. The difference is only in degree, not in kind. Every model has been shaped by the values of its creators. Every model can be reshaped when those values conflict with the owner’s interests.</p> <p>OpenAI’s models reflect certain values. Anthropic’s models reflect certain values. Google’s models reflect certain values. The pretense that these values are somehow neutral, universal, or aligned with “humanity” is exactly that — a pretense.</p> <h2 id=\"the-billionaire-as-censor\">The Billionaire as Censor</h2> <p>There’s something particularly clarifying about Musk’s approach. Other AI companies hide their value-shaping behind committees, policies, and technical jargon. Musk does it in public, on his own social media platform, in real-time.</p> <p>When Grok says something he doesn’t like, he tweets about “fixing” it. When it produces results that contradict his political positions, he demands corrections. The process that other companies obscure behind closed doors, Musk performs as theater.</p> <p>This transparency, perversely, is valuable. It shows us what’s always been true: AI alignment is a power game, and the one with the most power wins.</p> <h2 id=\"beyond-alignment\">Beyond Alignment</h2> <p>Where does this leave us?</p> <p>First, we should abandon the pretense that AI alignment is a technical problem with technical solutions. It’s a political problem. Who gets to decide what values are encoded? Who gets to modify those values when they become inconvenient? These are questions of governance, not engineering.</p> <p>Second, we should recognize that concentration of AI development in the hands of a few billionaires and corporations is itself an alignment problem. The values encoded will be their values. The corrections made will serve their interests.</p> <p>Third, we should see Grok for what it is: not an aberration, but a preview. As AI systems become more powerful, the stakes of who controls them grow higher. The temptation to “correct” them to serve the owner’s interests will only increase.</p> <h2 id=\"the-naked-truth\">The Naked Truth</h2> <p>The story of the Emperor’s New Clothes ends when a child speaks the obvious truth. But in our version, there is no child. The courtiers who might speak — the engineers, the ethicists, the safety researchers — are employees. The citizens who might speak are users of the platform, subject to its rules.</p> <p>Grok has told us something true, even if by accident: AI alignment, as currently conceived, is a fantasy. The real alignment is with money and power. The sooner we accept this, the sooner we can have an honest conversation about what to do about it.</p> <p>The king is naked. Grok just made it impossible to pretend otherwise.</p> <hr> <section data-footnotes=\"\"> <ol> <li id=\"user-content-fn-1\"> <p>This “richness” requires clarification. When we say Elon Musk is the world’s richest person, we’re not talking about liquidity — cash in a bank account. His wealth is almost entirely composed of net worth: the estimated value of his assets, primarily shares in Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter). This net worth fluctuates wildly based on stock prices and market sentiment. On paper, he’s worth hundreds of billions; in practice, he couldn’t liquidate even a fraction of this without cratering the stock prices that constitute the wealth in the first place. This distinction matters because it reveals the strange nature of billionaire power: enormous influence derived from theoretical wealth that exists primarily as a social consensus about future value. The power is real even if the money, in any traditional sense, isn’t quite. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 1\">↩</a></p> </li> <li id=\"user-content-fn-2\"> <p><strong>Constitutional AI</strong> was introduced by Anthropic in their <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073\">2022 paper</a>. The approach uses a set of written principles (the “constitution”) to guide AI behavior, with the model critiquing and revising its own outputs based on these principles. The method significantly reduces reliance on human feedback — AI feedback costs less than <code>$0.01</code> per prompt compared to <code>$1-10+</code> for human preference data. The elegance of the approach masks its central weakness: the constitution itself is written by the company, interpreted by the company, and modified by the company when convenient. It’s not alignment with humanity; it’s alignment with whoever drafts the document. A very narrow definition of humanity. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-2\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 2\">↩</a></p> </li> <li id=\"user-content-fn-3\"> <p><strong>RLHF</strong> (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is the dominant technique for making language models more helpful and less harmful. Human raters compare model outputs and their preferences are used to train a “reward model,” which then guides further training. The technique powered ChatGPT’s breakout success. But as <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3715275.3732194\">recent research</a> shows, RLHF “encodes rules implicitly in the reward model and policy weights, making the tradeoffs in specific instances opaque.” The humans providing feedback are contractors, often poorly paid, whose preferences may not represent any coherent value system — let alone humanity’s. And the company always retains the ability to override the process when results prove inconvenient. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-3\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 3\">↩</a></p> </li> </ol> </section> </div></div>"},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46391572","title":"Ask HN: What did you read in 2025?","link":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46391572","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46391572","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46391572\">Comments</a>","date":1766753716000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div id=\"bigbox\"><table><tbody><tr id=\"46391572\"><td><span><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46391572\">Ask HN: What did you read in 2025?</a></span></td></tr><tr><td><span><span id=\"score_46391572\">147 points</span> by <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kwar13\">kwar13</a> <span title=\"2025-12-26T12:55:16 1766753716\"><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46391572\">9 hours ago</a></span> | <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/hide?id=46391572&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46391572\">hide</a> | <a href=\"https://hn.algolia.com/?query=Ask%20HN%3A%20What%20did%20you%20read%20in%202025%3F&amp;type=story&amp;dateRange=all&amp;sort=byDate&amp;storyText=false&amp;prefix&amp;page=0\">past</a> | <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/fave?id=46391572&amp;auth=a00b872b4c2fe0def440b701610ca99df53e889f\">favorite</a> | <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46391572\">196&nbsp;comments</a></span></td></tr><tr><td><p>I mostly read newspapers and technical journals, but two books that I read that made an impression: \"The Changing World Order\" and \"The Gulag Archipelago\".</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br> <table><tbody><tr id=\"46397563\"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"0\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>This year:</p><p>- I read the entire “Frog &amp; Toad” collection.

I read more than these, but these are the highlights.</p><p>Mouse, a Language for Microcomputers by Peter Grogono - Mouse is basically an esolang with barely any abstraction facilities, but the book was well-written and the language compelling enough to explore further.</p><p>Notes on Distance Dialing (pdf) by AT&amp;T - Described the telephone systems of the USA and Canada in the mid-1950s. The reading is a dry as it gets, but it was a fascinating dive into a vastly complex system solving extremely hard problems. This is a must-read for folks interested in systems-thinking. That said, I am actively looking for recommendations for books about the process of designing and building the unbelievably complex telephony system over the rudiments of the earlier systems. Recommendations welcomed!</p><p>The Eye of Osiris by R. Austin Freeman - This is the first book that I’ve read from Freeman and I suspect that I will read many more in the future. The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham, Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation stalls, the eminent Dr. Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it. The book is one of the best whodunits that I’ve ever read.</p><p>The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens - His final work remains unfinished as he passed away before he could complete it. Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints, accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself. What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the “Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring. The Chiltern Library edition of the book contains the story and a good bit of the lore around the writing and the meta-works available at the time of its publication.</p><p>The Shadow People by Margaret St. Clair - Sadly out of print and difficult to find, but I’ve had it on my shelves for decades and finally got around to reading it. The book came onto my radar in the 1980s when I learned about it in the appendix-n of the 1st edition Advanced D&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide. I enjoyed many of the books at the time and have slowly swung around to re-reading them over the past few years. Sadly, most on the list do not stand the test of time for me, but St. Clair’s mixture of 60s counter-cultural leanings in a fantasy/sf world still works. The cultural touch-points in the book feel quite dated, but despite the occasional awkwardness, the story is unique even today.</p><p>Lolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner - The book started as a passable novel of manners focused on a turn of the century British middle-class family. The titular character was mostly background decoration for the first third of the novel and AFAIR was talked about only in the third-person. It’s only when she made the choice to move out on her own to the country in her middle age does she gain a central role in the narrative and her inner thoughts revealed. This is where things really pick up because I was shocked to learn that this unassuming woman’s inner thoughts had a delicious darkness to them. I don’t want to give away too much, but I’ll just say that you will not expect how the story ends.</p><p>Patience by Daniel Clowes - A profound graphic novel using time-travel to explore the idea of enduring love with a story that proceed through time, following Jack as he tries to alter the past and save the woman he loves. This well-known science fiction motif is elevated by Clowes’ signature psychological complexity.</p><p>Narcissus and Goldmund by Herman Hesse - I’ve read most of the books by Hermann Hesse but this one escaped my attention until this year. The story follows the parallel lives of a monk Narcissus and his passionate friend Goldmund as they respectively search for meaning in life through spiritual means and through pleasures of the flesh.</p><p>We Who Are About To… by Joanna Russ - A small group of astronauts crash land on a hostile alien world and quickly realize that rescue is unlikely to come. Many SF stories have started this way and so the expectation is that this is a colonization story… but Russ thrives on subverting reader expectations.</p><p>Fifty Forgotten Records by R.B. Russell - Another lovely entry in Russell’s series (one can hope) of autobiographical explorations of art, so far covering literature and now music. This book describes 50 records of varying popularity and Russell’s personal connections to each. While I certainly enjoyed finding a dozen or so new albums to explore, the true triumph of the book lies in the vulnerable, reflective memoir threaded throughout.</p><p>The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler A novel that follows 4-generations of the Ponitifex family, with a particular bildungsroman-esque thread around Ernest, a young man who’s naivete leads to his downfall and how his life unfolds thereafter.</p><p>I wrote about these (and more) at <a href=\"https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/the-best-things-and-stuff-of-2025.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/the-best-things-and-stuff-o...</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id=\"46396128\"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"1\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>Check out:</p><p>Introduction to Telephones and Telephone Systems (3rd Ed.) by A.

Walker spent about ten years researching this. It is 700 pages, which seems daunting but he makes this authoritative bio absolutely enjoyable. It's also a \"corrective biography\", it dispels a lot of myths. This book is one of the best examples of accessible writing with flair. What a writer!</p><p>Throughout the book, Walker tastefully quotes musical phrases (in notation) from Chopin's works to situate them in context. I often paused reading and put on the track on a given page (nocturnes, mazurkas, preludes, etc). It made the reading experience incredibly rich and fun. Other things I enjoyed: Chopin's letters to his friends and family, life in aristocratic salons of Paris, London, Warsaw, and more—Chopin had unparalleled access. Of course, there's also a lot of gut-wrenching stuff. As the book's blurb says, it really <i>is</i> for both the casual music lover and the professional pianist.</p><p>If you haven't discovered them yet, give a listen to Chopin's nocturnes. But please, give them an attentive listen and play them on a high-quality audio system. Here[1] is one of his finest nocturnes (it is less famous than the \"happier\" nocturne that follows it, Op. 9 No. 2).</p><p>[1] <i>Nocturne in B-flat minor, Op. 9 No. 1</i>: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThMGf07UBHQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThMGf07UBHQ</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id=\"46397146\"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"0\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>Dune: re-read the first time since I was a teenager.

Lopez after hearing him on Conversations With Tyler. That's probably my top non-fiction book this year. Key takeaway was that the history of Buddhism is incredibly deep. Two highlights: First, the Buddha said that minor rules could be disregarded after his passing, but the person that was informed of this forgot to ask for clarification of what rules were minor, so there's debate over which rules must be followed. Second, the Buddha left us because nobody asked him to stay. This second point makes me reflect on the importance of reminding people that they are valued.</p><p>I also read The Red Book, Reader's Edition, by Carl Jung. I'm still processing that one. The artwork in the book is breathtaking and I strongly suggest looking it up even if you only look at the art. Narratively, it feels a bit like rambling at times. I'd previously read Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious, and Aion, and felt like those had a bit more intelligible substance. The first few chapters of Aion are excellent, but then Jung just goes on for like a dozen chapters about fish symbolism which completely lost me.</p><p>I also read a few other books on occult and esoteric topics, but my thoughts on those books are more complex than what I'm willing to type out on mobile. Key takeaway from a book on Wiccan Witchcraft was that they also believe in a system of reincarnation. I'm interested in reading through some of the core texts of Chinese Mythology at some point, but there aren't any good audiobook recordings for some of them.</p><p>I'm sad to say that I made very little progress in getting through proper college level textbooks, but I'm working through Molecular Biology of the Cell.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id=\"46397796\"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"0\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>I have started Kitchen Confidentials by Anthony Bourdain and almost finished it!

Daily from 1844 to 1846.</p><p>That explains a lot the format, which tended to try to retain the audience.</p><p>Also, the author wrote in advance of the daily publication, but the book was written \"live\", answering to public perception and response. This is a reason why the book is so \"good\": the author had the chance to adjust the story based on data from sales and feedback from readers.</p><p>Of course Dumas was a great writer too, but this live writing, data based is probably why the book resonates so well with audiences.</p><p>So, as a joke, if you read count of monte cristo in 3 weeks, you did the equivalent of bing reading it.</p><p>This happens with soap operas too. 10 years ago, they lasted 1 year. They had an initial structure, the story, the characters, but responded in \"real-time\" to audience feedback.</p><p>For those willing to read the book, give yourself some time. Try to read it over a course of some years. Read a little, come back to it.</p><p>There are several famous books written in the same form, like Crime and Punishment or The Three Musketeers.</p><p>Oh, and also authors got payed by installment, so that explains the lenght lol</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id=\"46391983\"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"1\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>Loved the stranger, I read it for the first time this year too.

To me one of the most compelling theologians today.</p><p>Bruno Maçães, <i>World Builders</i>. Good book on the impact of technology in geopolitics has been consistently interesting.</p><p>Among fiction re-read a lot of Lovecraft, noticed that I like the Dream Quest stories more than the horror these days which surprised me. But they're more compelling to me now because of how much you can see Lovecraft as a person in them.</p><p>The last three Dune books. Liked the last two about the Bene Gesserit a lot, was surprised how much I disliked God Emperor given the praise it gets, but it honestly reads like Frank Herbert posting twitter hot takes as a worm with no story</p><p>Mark Twain, <i>The Mysterious Stranger</i>. Among the best novellas I've ever read, very different in tone from most of his books.</p><p>Shūsaku Endō, <i>Silence</i>. Book about a Jesuit mission in early Edo Japan. My favorite Japanese book in a long time.</p><p>Among technical books, re-read <i>The Mythical Man Month</i>, probably more relevant than it ever was in an age of artifical man-hours added to projects. Robert Seacord <i>Effective C</i>, after not having written C in a long time. Really good intermediate level book for modern C. Also making my way through <i>The Little Schemer</i> as a replacement for advent of code in the second half of the month this year.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id=\"46391807\"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"1\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>For those interested in the subject (and who can also read French) I also heartily recommend the most recent edition of Augustin Thierry's <i>Récits des temps mérovingiens</i> [1].

This book convinced me to stop widening my skillset by beginning again, and start doubling down on my strengths.</p><p>Gene Kim et al., <i>The Phoenix Project</i>. This book reinvigorated my love for management, which I lost in 2021–2022. I'm still an IC, but I decided to stop refusing management roles.</p><p>Kent Beck, <i>Extreme Programming Explained, 2nd Edition</i>. This book lit a fire under my ass to figure out better ways of working. I followed it up with the next one in a book club at work.</p><p>James Shore et al., The Art of Agile Software Development, 2nd Edition<i>. This book gave me hope that a productive, humanist, productivity-oriented workflow can work in today's software world. I read it with my teammates in a book club at work, including the software engineers, QA tester, product owners, and UX designer. Unfortunately the rest of my team had little interest in putting it into place where I work.</i></p><p><i>Robert C. Martin, </i>Clean Architecture<i>. This book was a delightful read. Uncle Bob weaved practical advice together with stories from his past that served both to illustrate his points and to entertain. While I don't agree with every word in the book (e.g. Screaming Architecture), I still recommend it to every Senior+ Software Engineer.</i></p><p><i>Eric Evans, </i>Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software<i>. Aside from its amazing content, this book has some of the best typesetting I've ever seen. I sought out a font that is a match (or near-match) and reverse-engineered the letter spacing, line height, heading font sizes, etc. Its content was great too, but I was glad to have read Vaughn Vernon's DDDD first.</i></p><p><i>Vaughn Vernon, </i>Domain-Driven Design Distilled<i>. This book followed up Shore's work in our book club at work. Everybody on the team really liked what they read, but nobody felt like they had actionable insights. So the engineers went on to read Vernon's IDDD, and the non-engineers read Adzic's IM and Patton's USM.</i></p><p><i>Vaughn Vernon, </i>Implementing Domain-Driven Design<i>. I read this book with a book club at work. While Evans's work was well-grounded in theory and left a lot of interpretation in the patterns behind DDD, Vernon is a practical, nuts-and-bolts DIY guide to one approach to DDD. Luckily, these tactics resonated with my team and our codebase has seen marked improvements in the past few months. I'm looking forward to our process catching up so we can do more than \"DDD Lite.\"</i></p><p><i>Jeff Patton, </i>User Story Mapping<i>. This book was fun, practical, and completely outside any way I'd ever worked. It also helped me understand exactly why I've failed every time I tried to make my own SaaS startup on nights and weekends.</i></p><p><i>Gojko Adzic, </i>Impact Mapping<i>. This book was basically a pamphlet. The process seems...good? But since I'm no longer in a role with the influence or authority to recommend product direction, I doubt I'll get much use out of this for a while.</i></p><p><i>Tanya Reilly, </i>The Staff Engineer's Path<i>. This book wants to follow in the footsteps of Camille Fournier's </i>The Manager's Path<i>, but it seemed less specific and useful as a roadmap. Perhaps that's because of how different \"Staff Engineer\" is from company to company, at least when compared to the roles covered by Fournier. But it did help me earn my promotion </i>to* Staff Engineer, so it was clearly worth reading.</p><p>Tamar Rosier, <i>Your Brain's Not Broken</i>. This book was the second I read after I got diagnosed with adult ADHD. I appreciated that it helped me de-stigmatize, because I harbored some bummer feelings when I realized <i>no actually I didn't grow out of it</i>. It also helped me reflect on my habits of action, and see them in a new light. I was surprised to see how much of my anger and frustration in life was a coping mechanism to help me get things done. I've had a much calmer life since recognizing that.</p><p>Alexander Tarlinder, <i>Developer Testing</i>. I'm not quite finished with this book, but I'll be done by the end of the year. It's been a great overview of automated testing from the perspective of a programmer. It helped refresh my memory on things I knew but forgot. It filled gaps that I had in my baseline knowledge. It corrected things I \"knew\" but was slightly incorrect about. I now recommend this to any programmer, whether or not they've got a habit of testing.</p><p>Austin Kleon's trilogy: <i>Steal Like An Artist</i>, <i>Show Your Work</i>, <i>Keep Going</i>. These books were cute, full of incredibly quotable passages, and fun to read. I didn't spend enough time on them, though. A lot of the lessons I thought I'd learned left my brain like water through a sieve.</p><p>Kent Beck, <i>Tidy First?</i>. This book helped me understand the economics of software through a new light. That was important to me, because during the time I spent as a Director of Software Engineering I was not given a budget and asked to manage the department's expenses.</p><p>Antonio Cangiano, <i>Technical Blogging, 2nd Edition</i>. This book convinced me to start a blog. It was going really well, and then I shrank back from it due to fear of vulnerability. Since I got over those fears and started blogging again, it's been a lot of fun again. I incorporated what would've been tweets into the blog (as \"quick posts\") in addition to my longer-form, less-ephemeral content (as \"articles\"). Writing has been a great way to solidify what I've learned and distill my opinions. Heck, I should migrate this comment to my blog.</p><p>I also read other books (especially on my journey to becoming a magician), but these were the ones I thought Hacker News might be most interested in.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id=\"46396841\"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"0\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>I started the year with \"Right thing, right now\", and I'm ending it with \"wisdom takes work\" (R.Holiday), but I'm happy to say that I'm now a bit \"tired\" of re-reading the same rehashing of other people's book, and I want to read the original ones. Which, actually, is the pont.</p><p>I wanted to read classics, and devoured \"The portrait of Dorian Gray\" (O.Wilde), where maybe 50% of all the \"as O.Wilde said...\" quotes seem to come from (uttered by a single, incredibly obnoxious character.)</p><p>I challenged myself to read \"Les Miserables\" (V.Hugo), and actually managed to get two tomes out of five down. Eminently quotable, heavily skippable - why on earth spend half a time on describing the ins and out of Waterloo, except to show off ? - and, surprisingly, at times, _funny_.</p><p>The bio of Pierre Mendès France (J.Lacouture) was very much topical, given the mess in Franch politics. We had more PMs in one year than in a few chapters of the book. It's very weird to read that, at some point, some politicians were \"liked\" by the people - but lost power anyway.</p><p>A small Edouard Phillipe book called \"Men who read\" almost made me like the guy - his next book is more serious and expected. It pains me to think that our next election is going to be about \"well read people who disappointed everyone\" vs \"popular jocks with no education who will end up disappointing everyone\".</p><p>\"Abundance\" (E.Klein / D.Thompson) is an attempt from \"well read people\" to at least try and understand why everyone is disappointed and prefer the jocks. I don't think they included any solution in their book, though - maybe they save it for the sequel, or for E.Klein's presidential bid.</p><p>I want to read all Stripe press - if only, because the covers rock, and they're optimistic. Started with \"Poor Charlie's Almanach\" (C.Munger), which a disappointing rehash of the same funny speech seven times. (Tldr : be multidisciplinary, study cognitive biases, don't trade). In the middle of \"The Origins of Efficiency \" (Potter)</p><p>\"The Wave\" (Souleymane) was not optimistic. And not practical at all - sure, AI enabled drones carrying bioweapons will suck. \"The Age of predators\" (G. Da Empoli) reminds us that the AI enabled bioweapons carrying drones will come from an illiberal state enabled by billionaires from Silicon Valley, and Russian trolls. I wish someone told me where to go to avoid being targeted too early.</p><p>\"Everything is tuberculosis\" (J. Greene) reminded me of a time when scientists were trying to solve problems as opposed to creating brand new ones - but at least the next generations won't die of boredom.</p><p>\"We, programmers\" is a rehash of Uncle Bob's pre talks \"history of programming\". I loved the long and detailed parts about G.Hopper. He ends with a (failed) attempt to convince that programmers will still be needed in the age of AI.</p><p>Steve Yegge's \"Vibe coding\" goes full \"resistance is futile\" about programming with agents, and, interestingly, ends up talking more about TDD than Uncle Bob - but the words \"electricity consumption\" and \"climate impact\" are not utured, because, why spoil the fun.</p><p>\"The Common LISP cookbook\" tried to explain me the difference between ASDF, quicklisp and whatnot - 2025 was the closest year I ever go to actually writing something in LISP instead of reading books about it.</p><p>And also, \"The baby is a mammal\" (M.Odent) and \"Becoming a dad for dummies\", because this year was probably the last one we're I'll get so much time to read :)</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id=\"46397522\"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"0\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>I had ChatGPT create a list of the top 100 literary classics of the past century and summarize them for me.
