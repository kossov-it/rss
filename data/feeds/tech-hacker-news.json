I apologized for communicating performance results without noticing a compiler bug had occured.</p> <p>I can proudly say today that I am partially retracting that apology, but only for two platforms—MacOs AArch64 (XCode Clang) and Windows x86-64 (MSVC).</p> <p>In our own experiments, the tail calling interpreter for CPython was found to beat the computed goto interpreter by 5% on pyperformance on AArch64 macOS using XCode Clang, and roughly 15% on pyperformance on Windows on an experimental internal version of MSVC. The Windows build is against a switch-case interpreter, but this in theory shouldn’t matter too much, more on that in the next section.</p> <p>This is of course, a <strong>hopefully accurate</strong> result. I tried to be more diligent here, but I am of course not infallible. However, I have found that sharing early and making a fool of myself often works well, as it has led to people catching bugs in my code, so I shall continue doing so :).</p> <p>Also this assumes the change doesn’t get reverted later in Python 3.15’s development cycle.</p> <h2 id=\"brief-background-on-interpreters\">Brief background on interpreters</h2> <p>Just a recap. There are two popular current ways of writing C-based interpreters.</p> <p>Switch-cases:</p> <pre><code>switch (opcode) { case INST_1: ... case INST_2: ... } </code></pre> <p>Where we just switch-case to the correct instruction handler.</p> <p>And the other popular way is a GCC/Clang extension called labels-as-values/computed gotos.</p> <pre><code>goto *dispatch_table[opcode]; INST_1: ... INST_2: ... </code></pre> <p>Which is basically the same idea, but to instead jump to the address of the next label. Traditionally, the key optimization here is that it needs only one jump to go to the next instruction, while in the switch-case interpreter, a naiive compiler would need two jumps.</p> <p>With modern compilers however, the benefits of the computed gotos is a lot less, mainly because modern compilers have gotten better and modern hardware has also gotten better. In Nelson Elhage’s <a href=\"https://blog.nelhage.com/post/cpython-tail-call/\">excellent investigation</a> on the next kind of interpreter, the speedup of computed gotos over switch case on modern Clang was only in the low single digits on pyperformance.</p> <p>A 3rd way that was suggested decades ago, but not really entirely feasible is call/tail-call threaded interpreters. In this scheme, each bytecode handler is its own function, and we tail-call from one handler to the next in the instruction stream:</p> <div><pre><code>return dispatch_table[opcode]; PyObject *INST_1(...) { } PyObject *INST_2(...) { } </code></pre></div> <p>This wasn’t too feasible in C for one main reason—tail call optimization was merely an <em>optimization</em>. It’s something the C compiler might do, or might not do. This means if you’re unlucky and the C compiler chooses not to perform the tail call, your interpreter might stack overflow!</p> <p>Some time ago, Clang introduced <code>__attribute__((musttail))</code>, which allowed for mandating that a call <em>must</em> be tail-called. Otherwise, the compilation will fail. To my knowledge, the first time this was popularized for use in a mainstream interpreter was in <a href=\"https://blog.reverberate.org/2021/04/21/musttail-efficient-interpreters.html\">Josh Haberman’s Protobuf blog post</a>.</p> <p>Later on, Haoran Xu noticed that the GHC calling convention combined with tail calls produced efficient code. They used this for their baseline JIT in a paper and termed the technique <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3485513\">Copy-and-Patch</a>.</p> <h2 id=\"so-where-are-we-now\">So where are we now?</h2> <p>After using a fixed XCode Clang, our performance numbers on CPython 3.14/3.15 suggest that the tail calling interpreter does provide a modest speedup over computed gotos. Around the 5% geomean range on pyperformance.</p> <p>To my understanding, <code>uv</code> already ships Python 3.14 on macOS with tail calling, which might be responsible for some of the speedups you see on there. We’re planning to ship the official 3.15 macOS binaries on <code>python.org</code> with tail calling as well.</p> <p>However, you’re not here for that. The title of this blog post is clearly about MSVC Windows x86-64. So what about that?</p> <h2 id=\"tail-calling-for-windows\">Tail-calling for Windows</h2> <blockquote> <p>[!CAUTION] The features for MSVC discussed below are to my knowledge, experimental. They are not guaranteed to always be around unless the MSVC team decide to keep them. Use at your own risk!</p> </blockquote> <p>These are the preliminary pyperformance results for CPython on MSVC with tail-calling vs switch-case. Any number above 1.00x is a speedup (e.g. <code>1.01x == 1% speedup</code>), anything below 1.00x is a slowdown. The speedup is a geomtric mean of around 15-16%, with a range of ~60% slowdown (one or two outliers) to 78% speedup. However, the key thing is that the vast majority of benchmaarks sped up!</p> <p><img src=\"https://fidget-spinner.github.io/posts/media/TC-PGO-Ex3-vs-PGO.svg\" alt=\"Tailcall results\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p> <p><em>Chart credits to Michael Droettboom</em></p> <blockquote> <p>[!WARNING] These results are on an experimental internal MSVC compiler, public results below.</p> </blockquote> <p>To verify this and make sure I wasn’t wrong yet again, I checked the results on my machine with Visual Studio 2026. These are the results from <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/139922\">this issue</a>.</p> <div><pre><code>Mean +- std dev: [spectralnorm_tc_no] 146 ms +- 1 ms -&gt; [spectralnorm_tc] 98.3 ms +- 1.1 ms: 1.48x faster Mean +- std dev: [nbody_tc_no] 145 ms +- 2 ms -&gt; [nbody_tc] 107 ms +- 2 ms: 1.35x faster Mean +- std dev: [bm_django_template_tc_no] 26.9 ms +- 0.5 ms -&gt; [bm_django_template_tc] 22.8 ms +- 0.4 ms: 1.18x faster Mean +- std dev: [xdsl_tc_no] 64.2 ms +- 1.6 ms -&gt; [xdsl_tc] 56.1 ms +- 1.5 ms: 1.14x faster </code></pre></div> <p>So yeah, the speedups are real! For a large-ish library like xDSL, we see a 14% speedup, while for smaller microbenchmarks like nbody and spectralnorm, the speedups are greater.</p> <p>Thanks to Chris Eibl and Brandt Bucher, we managed to get the <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/143068\">PR for this</a> on MSVC over the finish line. I also want to sincerely thank the MSVC team. I can’t say this enough: they have been a joy to work with and I’m very impressed by what they’ve done, and I want to congratulate them on releasing Visual Studio 2026.</p> <p>This is now listed in the What’s New for 3.15 notes:</p> <blockquote> <p>Builds using Visual Studio 2026 (MSVC 18) may now use the new tail-calling interpreter. Results on an early experimental MSVC compiler reported roughly 15% speedup on the geometric mean of pyperformance on Windows x86-64 over the switch-case interpreter. We have observed speedups ranging from 15% for large pure-Python libraries to 40% for long-running small pure-Python scripts on Windows.

While I still believe that now, I suspect that is not the main reason for speedups in CPython.</p> <p>My main guess now is that <strong>tail calling resets compiler heuristics to sane levels, so that compilers can do their jobs</strong>.</p> <p>Let me show an example, at the time of writing, CPython 3.15’s interpreter loop is around <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Python/generated_cases.c.h\">12k</a> lines of C code. That’s 12k lines in a <strong>single</strong> function for the switch-case and computed goto interpreter.</p> <p>This has caused many issues for compilers in the past, too many to list in fact. I have a EuroPython 2025 talk about this. In short, this overly large function breaks a lot of compiler heuristics.</p> <p>One of the most beneficial optimisations is inlining. In the past, we’ve found that compilers sometimes straight up <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121263\">refuse</a> to inline even the simplest of functions in that 12k loc eval loop. I want to stress that this is not the fault of the compiler. It’s actually doing the correct thing—you usually don’t want to increase the code size of something already super large. Unfortunately, this does’t bode well for our interpreter.</p> <p>You might say just write the interpreter in assembly! However, the whole point of this exercise is to not do that.</p> <p>Ok enough talk, let’s take a look at the code now. Taking a real example, we examine <code>BINARY_OP_ADD_INT</code> which adds two Python integers. Cleaning up the code so it’s readable, things look like this:</p> <pre><code>TARGET(BINARY_OP_ADD_INT) { // Increment the instruction pointer. _Py_CODEUNIT* const this_instr = next_instr; frame-&gt;instr_ptr = next_instr; next_instr += 6; _PyStackRef right = stack_pointer[-1]; // Check that LHS is an int. PyObject *value_o = PyStackRef_AsPyObjectBorrow(left); if (!_PyLong_CheckExactAndCompact(value_o)) { JUMP_TO_PREDICTED(BINARY_OP); } // Check that RHS is an int. // ... (same code as above for LHS) // Add them together. PyObject *left_o = PyStackRef_AsPyObjectBorrow(left); PyObject *right_o = PyStackRef_AsPyObjectBorrow(right); res = _PyCompactLong_Add((PyLongObject *)left_o, (PyLongObject *)right_o); // If the addition fails, fall back to the generic instruction. if (PyStackRef_IsNull(res)) { JUMP_TO_PREDICTED(BINARY_OP); } // Close the references. PyStackRef_CLOSE_SPECIALIZED(left, _PyLong_ExactDealloc); PyStackRef_CLOSE_SPECIALIZED(right, _PyLong_ExactDealloc); // Write to the stack, and dispatch. stack_pointer[-2] = res; stack_pointer += -1; DISPATCH(); } </code></pre> <p>Seems simple enough, let’s take a look at the assembly for switch-case on VS 2026. Note again, this is a non-PGO build for easy source information, PGO generally makes some of these problems go away, but not all of them:</p> <pre><code> if (!_PyLong_CheckExactAndCompact(value_o)) { 00007FFC4DE24DCE mov rcx,rbx 00007FFC4DE24DD1 mov qword ptr [rsp+58h],rax 00007FFC4DE24DD6 call _PyLong_CheckExactAndCompact (07FFC4DE227F0h) 00007FFC4DE24DDB test eax,eax 00007FFC4DE24DDD je _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault+10EFh (07FFC4DE258FFh) ... res = _PyCompactLong_Add((PyLongObject *)left_o, (PyLongObject *)right_o); 00007FFC4DE24DFF mov rdx,rbx 00007FFC4DE24E02 mov rcx,r15 00007FFC4DE24E05 call _PyCompactLong_Add (07FFC4DD34150h) 00007FFC4DE24E0A mov rbx,rax ...

Most of my customers do.</p> <p>During a phone order one season – 2018 I believe – a customer shared this story where he smuggled some Vidalias onto his vacation cruise ship, and during each meal, would instruct the server to ‘<em>take this onion to the back, chop it up, and add it onto my salad</em> ‘. That story made me smile.</p> <p>Folks who love Vidalias, <em>love Vidalias</em>.</p> <p>Let me stop, though. I don’t want to get ahead of myself.</p> <p>How did all this start? I’m a web guy. I’m not a farmer.</p> <hr> <h2>I’M ADDICTED TO DOMAIN NAMES</h2> <p>Oddly enough, it <u>didn’t</u> start with an idea.</p> <p>Back in 2014, the domain name <a href=\"https://www.vidaliaonions.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VidaliaOnions.com</a> expired, and went up for auction. For some reason the original owner abandoned it, and being a Georgia native, I recognized it ’cause I was familiar with the industry. I’ve <a href=\"https://www.deepsouthventures.com/build-a-side-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">been buying expired or abandoned domain names</a> for a while, and enjoy developing them into niche businesses. This one was different though – I backordered the domain as a spectator, but for kicks &amp; giggles, I dropped in a bid around $2,200 ’cause I was confident I’d be outbid. </p> <p>5 minutes later, I was the proud owner of VidaliaOnions.com. I had no idea what to do with it. Ready, fire, aim.</p> <p>After the domain landed in my account, I attempted to re-focus my attention on other projects, but the name kept clawing me. Like it was saying:</p> <blockquote><p>… yoo-hoo… over here… 😘</p></blockquote> <hr> <p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/william-faulkner-bench-480.jpg\" alt=\"William faulkner statue on bench\" width=\"480\" height=\"358\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p> <p>William Faulkner had an interesting perspective on writing his characters – on how <em>they essentially wrote themselves</em>, and how <em>he</em> (Faulkner) served as a sortof mechanical in-between. His quote:</p> <blockquote><p><em>I would say to get the character in your mind. Once he is in your mind, and he is right, and he’s true, then he does the work himself. All you need to do then is to trot along behind him and put down what he does and what he says… You’ve got to know the character. You’ve got to believe in him. You’ve got to feel that he is alive… After that, the business of putting him down on paper is mechanical. <a href=\"https://faulkner.lib.virginia.edu/display/wfaudio21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[source]</a></em></p></blockquote> <p>The way Faulkner treats his characters, I treat domain name projects. I buy them with an intention to develop. And I let <u>them</u> take the lead. They’re the inspiration for the business itself. They guide me towards what they need to become. I’m just the dude behind the keyboard (sorta).</p> <p>Sometimes I buy them at auction, sometimes I buy them from original-owners. But universally, the domain name always comes first, the business idea comes second. </p> <p>I don’t usually rush into development. The path of some domains is apparent before I acquire. Others, the path reveals itself down the road. Vidalia was the latter. And after I acquired it, it kept nudging me.</p> <blockquote><p>Build me… build me… you know how. And you <em>know</em> what I should be…</p></blockquote> <p>After a month, I began to understand what it was telling me. That I buy pears from Harry &amp; David every year, and I should mimic that same service for Vidalia Onions. Instead of farm-to-door pears, farm-to-door Vidalia Onions. </p> <p>An interesting idea, but daunting to approach. I’m not a farmer, I don’t have employees, I don’t have a packing shed. And I have no logistics or distribution system setup.</p> <p>But the domain name kept staring at me. ಠ~ಠ ////<em>whispering</em>////</p> <blockquote><p>… just start …</p></blockquote> <hr> <h2>“take the path to Nothing, and go Nowhere until you reach it.”</h2><p><em>-the tao of pooh</em></p> <p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/indy-leap-faith.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"320\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p> <p>…</p> <p>And so I did. I’m just dumb enough to try a project of this complexity. The market size justified an online venture. Google Trends showed strong search volume for the phrase. And chefs around the world had already belted their praise over the ‘caviar of sweet onions’. </p> <p>So I just started down a path, with no end goal or milestone set. I just started going. No angel investor. No VC backer. I just used some modest profit from my other <a href=\"https://www.deepsouthventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">domain name developments</a> to fund the endeavor. This was Feb of 2015.</p> <p>Once I began, I discovered there was a Vidalia Onion committee which represents all the Vidalia farmers. So I reached out to them.</p> <p>They were kind enough to listen to me.</p> <p>They introduced me to several farmers in the Vidalia region.</p> <p>I got along quite well with the 3rd farmer I met (Aries Haygood), so we decided to partner &amp; give this a shot. His farm had been around for 25 years; they hadn’t focused on direct-to-consumer; but they understood its value. They operated a packing shed as well. And most importantly, they grew an award winning Vidalia. </p> <p>And so we went. </p> <p>We conservatively estimated fifty (50) orders for our 2015 season. We ended up with over six hundred (600). </p> <p>While the farm concentrated on the Vidalia, I concentrated on customer service, marketing, branding, web development, &amp; logistics. I didn’t have other projects that were this front-facing, customer wise. And I discovered I immensely enjoyed it.</p> <p>The more we both focused on these efforts, the more we grew. So much so, that other Vidalia operations began shutting down their mail order efforts and simply directed folks our way.</p> <p>We began testing alternate marketing avenues – a billboard on I-95 just south of Savannah, GA facing northbound traffic; sponsoring a bike rider headed cross country for charity; sponsoring a high school basketball team, as well as a grade school auction fundraiser. </p> <p>We added a phone order hotline, which – from time to time – generates more sales than online.</p> <p>We also made a few colossal mistakes, which were entirely of my doing, like blowing $10,000 on faulty shipping boxes from an ill-informed &amp; misleading box manufacturer in Dalton, GA. (it happened early in our journey, and nearly forced me to shut down)</p> <p>Ultimately, I refused to let something like that kill this. Honestly, my customers would be quite upset if we disappeared. Last season, while I called a gentleman back regarding a phone order, his wife answered. While I introduced myself, she interrupted me mid-sentence and hollered in exaltation to her husband: ” THE VIDALIA MAN! THE VIDALIA MAN! PICK UP THE PHONE! ”</p> <p>At that moment, I realized we were doing something right. Something helpful. Something that was making a positive impact.</p> <p>I sometimes say I prefer projects that focus on purpose over profit. And as we enter our 5th season, this one continues to do just that.</p> <p>And it’s immensely gratifying. I feel so fortunate to be associated with this industry.</p> <p>I’m Peter Askew, and I sell onions on the internet.</p> <blockquote data-lang=\"en\"> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Them: We leverage automated machine learning to enhance your existing BI visualizations with more proactive insights</p> <p>Me: I sell onions on the internet</p> <p>— Peter Askew (@searchbound) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/searchbound/status/1007015211486900229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 13, 2018</a></p></blockquote> <hr> <p>** below – from the field during harvest – these have been dug &amp; are ready for clipping<br> ( click &amp; drag )</p> <hr> <p><span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/searchbound\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Follow me on Twitter</a> as I continue to document my journey there.

Somehow, I was running into some issues with <code>swaymsg</code>‘s handling of battery levels, and my computer ricing was due for a slight visual update anyway. It’s nice to save a tiny bit of screen real estate with icons instead of pure text, but of course, it is somewhat slower than Swaybar as it needs to render graphical stuff.

The mouse cursor movement and two finger scroll with inertia just feel incredibly natural, much better than my old Thinkpad X1 Carbon.</p> <p>One of the main reasons for getting the laptop was to use it for line scan photography. I was able to install the Alkeria SDK for ARM64 without any issues, even though it came as a deb file instead of an rpm. I didn’t manage to get <code>alien</code> to work properly (something about the architecture arm64 not matching Fedora’s convention of calling it aarch64?) so I just used bsdtar to extract the contents into the filesystem root, yolo!!!

Can sidewalls are much easier to cut and bend, so I'd recommend starting with that. Also be careful with the sharp scraps. I've been jabbed a few times making these.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Create the central dimple</strong><br> I usually just use a hard, blunt object like a ballpoint pen or pliers to push a dimple into the aluminum without crushing it. Can bottoms are made from thicker aluminum, so I had to gently tap on the back of the pen with a hammer to make the dimple. It's very easy to accidentally pierce the aluminum so be careful! </p><figure><img src=\"https://evan.widloski.com/posts/spinners/dimple.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><figcaption>Put your dimple at the center of mass</figcaption> </figure> </li> <li> <p><strong>Cut out blades and bend into shape.</strong><br> Small precision scissors work best to avoid distorting the aluminum and for making fine cuts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trim and balance.</strong><br> Balance the spinner on the pivot wire in your hand. Usually they're lopsided or fall off of their pivot initially, so trim small amounts of material from the outside until they spin well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Attach pivot wire to lamp</strong><br> Usually I'll just wrap the wire around the lampshade support (apparently this is called a \"harp\") or sandwich it under the lampshade nut for easy removal.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Incandescent bulbs work the best, but even LED bulbs are enough to get the spinners moving after warming up for a few minutes. After a few weeks of spinning, I've noticed the spinners made of thinner sidewall aluminum have very small pinholes from the pivot wire wearing through, but they haven't stopped spinning! The spinners made from can bottoms haven't had this problem yet.</p> <h2 id=\"gallery\"><a href=\"#gallery\">Gallery</a></h2> <figure><img src=\"https://evan.widloski.com/posts/spinners/turbine.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><figcaption>Turbine</figcaption> </figure> <figure><img src=\"https://evan.widloski.com/posts/spinners/propeller.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><figcaption>Propeller</figcaption> </figure> <figure><img src=\"https://evan.widloski.com/posts/spinners/out2.gif\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><figcaption>Flying Wing</figcaption> </figure> <figure><img src=\"https://evan.widloski.com/posts/spinners/big_turbine.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><figcaption>Big Turbine</figcaption> </figure> <figure><img src=\"https://evan.widloski.com/posts/spinners/jellyfish_turbine.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><figcaption>Jellyfish Turbine</figcaption> </figure> <figure><img src=\"https://evan.widloski.com/posts/spinners/dad_turbine.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><figcaption>Dad Turbine</figcaption> </figure> <figure><img src=\"https://evan.widloski.com/posts/spinners/windmill.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><figcaption>Windmill</figcaption> </figure> <figure><img src=\"https://evan.widloski.com/posts/spinners/IMG_4795.webp\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><figcaption>Dad Turbine, Propeller, Turbine, Windmill</figcaption> </figure> <figure><img src=\"https://evan.widloski.com/posts/spinners/double.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><figcaption>Doubledecker - Dad Turbine + Propeller</figcaption> </figure> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://evan.widloski.com/posts/spinners/IMG_5100.webp\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"> <figure><img src=\"https://evan.widloski.com/posts/spinners/hubcap.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><figcaption>Hubcap (this one sucked)</figcaption> </figure> <figure><img src=\"https://evan.widloski.com/posts/spinners/IMG_4798.webp\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"><figcaption>Big Turbine and Hubcap</figcaption> </figure>"},{"id":"https://git.dec05eba.com/phoenix/about/","title":"Phoenix: A modern X server written from scratch in Zig","link":"https://git.dec05eba.com/phoenix/about/","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46380075","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46380075\">Comments</a>","date":1766616233000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div id=\"summary\"><h2>Phoenix</h2> <p>Phoenix is a new X server, written from scratch in Zig (not a fork of Xorg server). This X server is designed to be a modern alternative to the Xorg server.</p> <h2>Current state</h2> <p>Phoenix is not ready to be used yet. At the moment it can render simple applications that do GLX, EGL or Vulkan graphics (fully hardware accelerated) nested in an existing X server. Running Phoenix nested will be the only supported mode until Phoenix has progressed more and can run real-world applications.</p> <h2>Goals</h2> <h3>Simplicity</h3> <p>Be a simpler X server than the Xorg server by only supporting a subset of the X11 protocol, the features that are needed by relatively modern applications (applications written/updated in the last ~20 years).<br> This includes <em>all</em> software that <em>you</em> use, even old gtk2 applications.<br> Only relatively modern hardware (made/updated in the last ~15-20 years) which support linux drm and mesa gbm will be supported, and no server driver interface like the Xorg server. Just like how Wayland compositors work.</p> <h3>Security</h3> <p>Be safer than the Xorg server by parsing protocol messages automatically. As it's written in Zig, it also automatically catches illegal behaviors (such as index out of array bounds) when building with the <code>ReleaseSafe</code> option.</p> <p>Applications will be isolated from each other by default and can only interact with other applications either through a GUI prompt asking for permission,<br> such as with screen recorders, where it will only be allowed to record the window specified or by explicitly giving the application permission before launched (such as a window manager or external compositor).<br> This will not break existing clients as clients wont receive errors when they try to access more than they need, they will instead receive dummy data.<br> Applications that rely on global hotkeys should work, as long as a modifier key is pressed (keys such as ctrl, shift, alt and super).<br> If an application needs global hotkeys without pressing a modifier key then it needs to be given permissions to do so (perhaps by adding a command to run a program with more X11 permissions).<br> There will be an option to disable this to make the X server behave like the Xorg server.</p> <h3>Improvements for modern technology</h3> <p>Support modern hardware better than the Xorg server, such as proper support for multiple monitors (different refresh rates, VRR - not a single framebuffer for the whole collection of displays) and technology like HDR.</p> <h3>Improved graphics handling</h3> <p>No tearing by default and a built-in compositor. The compositor will get disabled if the user runs an external compositor (client application), such as picom or if the client runs a fullscreen application.<br> The goal is to also have lower vsync/compositor latency than the Xorg server.</p> <h3>New standards</h3> <p>New standards will be developed and documented, such as per-monitor DPI as randr properties. Applications can use this property to scale their content to the specified DPI for the monitor they are on.</p> <h3>Extending the X11 protocol</h3> <p>If there is a need for new features (such as HDR) then the X11 protocol will be extended.</p> <h3>Wayland compatibility</h3> <p>Some applications might only run on Wayland in the future. Such applications should be supported by either Phoenix supporting Wayland natively or by running an external application that works as a bridge between Wayland and X11 (such as 12to11).</p> <h3>Nested display server</h3> <p>Being able to run Phoenix nested under X11 or Wayland with hardware acceleration. This is not only useful for debugging Phoenix but also for developers who want to test their window manager or compositor without restarting the display server they are running.<br> Being able to run Phoenix under Wayland as an alternative Xwayland server would be a good option.</p> <h2>Non-goals</h2> <h3>Replacing the Xorg server</h3> <p>The Xorg server will always support more features of the X11 protocol and wider range of hardware (especially older ones).</p> <h3>Multiple <em>screens</em></h3> <p>Multiple displays (monitors) are going to be supported but not X11 screens.</p> <h3>Exclusive access</h3> <p>GrabServer has no effect in Phoenix.</p> <h3>Endian-swapped client/server</h3> <p>This can be reconsidered if there is a reason.</p> <h3>Indirect (remote) GLX.</h3> <p>This is very complex as there are a lot of functions that would need to be implemented. These days remote streaming options are more efficient. Alternatively a proxy for glx could be implemented that does remote rendering.</p> <h2>Differences between the X11 protocol and Phoenix</h2> <h3>Core protocol</h3> <p>Several parts of the X11 protocol (core) are mandatory to be implemented by an X server, such as many font related operations.<br> However these are not going to be implemented in Phoenix, except for the simple ones that applications actually use (such as font operations used for cursors).<br> This will not affect applications that users actually use, even if they use old gtk2 applications.</p> <h3>Strings</h3> <p>Strings are in ISO Latin-1 encoding in the X11 protocol unless specified otherwise, however in Phoenix all strings are UTF-8 unless the protocol states that it's not an ISO Latin-1 string.</p> <h2>Installing</h2> <p>Run:</p> <pre><code>zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe sudo zig build install -p /usr/local -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe </code></pre> <h2>Uninstalling</h2> <p>Zig does currently not support the uninstall command so you have to remove files manually:</p> <pre><code>sudo rm /usr/local/bin/phoenix </code></pre> <h2>Building (for development)</h2> <p>Run <code>zig build</code>, which builds Phoenix in debug mode. The compiled binary will be available at <code>./zig-out/bin/phoenix</code>. You can alternatively build and run with one command: <code>zig build run</code>.</p> <h3>Generate x11 protocol documentation</h3> <p>Run <code>zig build -Dgenerate-docs=true</code>.

One takeaway kept repeating: when a platform accidentally treats attacker-shaped data as trusted structure, that boundary collapses fast. <strong>This time, the system that “breaks” isn’t your secret manager. It’s the agent framework that may use them.</strong></p> <p>Why this vulnerability deserves extra attention:</p> <ol> <li><strong>It’s in Core.</strong> This is not a specific tool bug, not an integration edge-case, and not a “some community package did something weird.” The vulnerable APIs (dumps() / dumpd()) live in <strong>langchain-core itself</strong>.</li> <li><strong>The blast radius is scale.</strong> By download volume, langchain is one of the most widely deployed AI framework components globally today. As of late December 2025, public package telemetry shows <strong>hundreds of millions of installs</strong>, with pepy.tech reporting <strong>~847M total downloads</strong> and pypistats showing <strong>~98M downloads in the last month</strong>.</li> <li><strong>One prompt can trigger a lot of machinery.</strong> The most common real-world path here is not “attacker sends you a serialized blob and you call load().” It’s subtler: LLM outputs can influence fields like additional_kwargs or response_metadata, and those fields can be serialized and later deserialized through normal framework features like streaming logs/events. Plainly, this means <strong>an exploit can be triggered by a single text prompt</strong> that cascades into a surprisingly complex internal pipeline.&nbsp;<br></li> </ol> <p>Before you read further, patches are now released in versions 1.2.5 and 0.3.81. If you’re running LangChain in production, this one is trickier than it may seem; please update ASAP.</p> <h2><strong>The short version of the bug</strong></h2> <p>LangChain uses a special internal serialization format where dictionaries containing an ‘lc’ marker represent LangChain objects. The vulnerability was that dumps() and dumpd() <strong>did not properly escape user-controlled dictionaries</strong> that happened to include the reserved ‘lc’ key.&nbsp;</p> <p>So once an attacker is able to make a LangChain orchestration loop serialize and later deserialize content including an ‘lc’ key, they would instantiate an unsafe arbitrary object, potentially triggering many attacker-friendly paths.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c67j-w6g6-q2cm\">advisory</a> lists <strong>12 distinct vulnerable flows</strong>, which are extremely common use cases, such as standard event streaming, logging, message history/memory or caches:</p> <figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;694d96940401c&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"221\" data-wp-class--hide=\"state.isContentHidden\" data-wp-class--show=\"state.isContentVisible\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-16-1024x221.png\" alt=\"\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></figure> <p>The most damaging outcomes include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Secret extraction</strong> from environment variables. The advisory notes this happens when deserialization is performed with secrets_from_env=True. Notably, <strong>this was the default until yesterday</strong>. 🙂&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Object instantiation</strong> within pre-approved namespaces (including <em>langchain_core</em>, <em>langchain_openai, langchain_aws, langchain_anthropic…</em>), potentially triggering side effects in constructors (network calls, file operations, etc.).&nbsp;</li> <li>Under certain conditions LangChain object instantiation may lead to arbitrary code execution.</li> </ul> <p>This is categorized under <strong>CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data</strong>, with a CNA CVSS score of <strong>9.3 (Critical)</strong>.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;694d969404c1e&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"627\" height=\"344\" data-wp-class--hide=\"state.isContentHidden\" data-wp-class--show=\"state.isContentVisible\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/banner-langgrinch.png\" alt=\"\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></figure> <h2><strong>My research story: how I stumbled into it</strong></h2> <p><br>’Twas the night before Christmas, and I was doing the least festive kind of work: staring at serialization code and asking “wait… why is that trusted?”</p> <p>Security research often looks dramatic from the outside. In reality, it is usually careful reading, small hypotheses, and a slow accumulation of “that’s odd” moments.</p> <p>This one started the way many do at Cyata: with a simple question we ask constantly as we assess AI stacks for real-world risk:</p> <p><em>Where are the trust boundaries in AI applications, and do developers actually know where those boundaries are?</em></p> <p>LangChain is a powerful framework, and like most modern frameworks it has to move complex structured data around: messages, tool calls, streaming events, traces, caches, and “runnables.”</p> <div><p>Reviewing previous research, there was already extensive research on LangChain tooling and integrations, but very few findings on the core library.</p><p>I started the research working backwards. Finding interesting locations (sinks), then figuring out how an attacker might reach them. Deserialization was an obvious target.</p><p>It took me quite a while to find something meaningful. But after a while, I found that assuming an attacker-controlled deserialization primitive, I could trigger blind SSRF that could be leveraged to exfiltrate environment variables (to be detailed soon). Because the outcome was limited to secret exfil, instead of my primary RCE goal, I kept auditing the deserialization, and took my time.</p><p>The bug wasn’t a piece of bad code, it was the absence of code. dumps() simply didn’t escape user-controlled dictionaries containing ‘lc’&nbsp; keys. A missing escape in the serialization path, not the deserialization.</p></div> <figure data-wp-context=\"{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;694d9694057c4&quot;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"342\" data-wp-class--hide=\"state.isContentHidden\" data-wp-class--show=\"state.isContentVisible\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2-1024x342.png\" alt=\"\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></figure> <p>It’s much easier to spot something wrong than to notice something missing, especially when you’re auditing load(), not dumps(). In one of the most scrutinized AI frameworks. For two and a half years.</p> <p>From there, the investigation became a structured exercise:</p> <ol> <li>Identify where <strong>untrusted content</strong> (mostly arbitrary dictionaries) gets serialized (LLM outputs, prompt injection, user input, external tools, retrieved docs).</li> <li>Identify when that serialized data gets deserialized.</li> <li>Identify what an attacker can achieve from arbitrary object instantiation.</li> </ol> <p>At that point, the core finding was clear and actionable enough to responsibly report: there was an escaping gap in dumps() / dumpd() around ‘lc’ key dictionaries.&nbsp;</p> <p>The advisory later captured what we often see in practice: fields like additional_kwargs and response_metadata can be influenced by LLM output and prompt injection, and those fields can get serialized-deserialized in many flows.&nbsp;</p> <p>To the LangChain team’s credit: the response and follow-through were decisive, not just patching the bug but also hardening defaults that were too permissive for the world we’re in now.&nbsp;</p> <p>The LangChain project decided to award a $4,000 USD bounty for this finding. According to huntr, the platform where LangChain operated its bounty program, this would be the maximum amount ever awarded in the project, with bounties so far awarded up to $125.</p> <h2><strong>Technical deep dive</strong></h2> <h3><strong>Background: the “lc” marker and why it exists</strong></h3> <p>LangChain serializes certain objects using a structured dict format. The ‘lc’ key is used internally to indicate “this is a LangChain-serialized structure,” not just arbitrary user data.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is a common pattern, but it creates a security invariant: Any user-controlled data that could contain ‘lc’ must be treated carefully. Otherwise, an attacker can craft a dict that “looks like” an internal object and trick the deserializer into giving it meaning.</p> <p>The patch makes the intent explicit in the updated documentation: during serialization, <strong>plain dicts that contain an ‘lc’ key are escaped</strong> by wrapping them.&nbsp;</p> <p>This prevents those dicts from being confused with actual LangChain serialized objects during deserialization.&nbsp;</p> <h3><strong>The allowlist: what can be instantiated</strong></h3> <p>LangChain’s load()/loads() functions don’t instantiate arbitrary classes – they check against an allowlist that controls which classes can be deserialized. By default, this allowlist includes classes from langchain_core, langchain_openai, langchain_aws, and other ecosystem packages.</p> <p>Here’s the catch: most classes on the allowlist have harmless constructors. Finding exploitable paths required digging through the ecosystem for classes that do something meaningful on instantiation. The ones I found are detailed below, but there may be others waiting to be discovered.</p> <h3><strong>The exfiltration path</strong></h3> <p>LangChain’s loads() function supports a <em>secret</em> type that resolves values from environment variables during deserialization. Before the patch, this feature <em>secrets_from_env</em> was enabled by default:</p> <pre><code>if ( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value.get(\"lc\") == 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and value.get(\"type\") == \"secret\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and value.get(\"id\") is not None ): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[key] = value[\"id\"] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if key in self.secrets_map: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return self.secrets_map[key] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if self.secrets_from_env and key in os.environ and os.environ[key]: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return os.environ[key] # <strong>&lt;-- Returning env variable</strong> &nbsp; return None</code></pre> <div><p>If a deserialized object is returned to an attacker, for example message history inside the LLM context, that could leak environment variables.</p><p>But the more interesting path is an indirect prompt injection.&nbsp;Even an attacker who cannot see any LLM responses can exfiltrate secrets by instantiating the right class. <em>ChatBedrockConverse</em> from <em>langchain_aws</em> is both in the default allowlist of <em>loads</em> and makes a GET request on construction.<br>The GET endpoint is attacker-controlled, and a specific HTTP header can be populated with an environment variable via the <em>secrets_from_env</em> feature.</p></div> <figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"720\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://cyata.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></figure> <p>This validator runs when <em>ChatBedrockConverse</em> is instantiated. The attacker controls <em>endpoint_url</em>, triggering an outbound request. Combined with <em>secrets_from_env</em>, the <em>aws_access_key_id</em> header can be populated with any environment variable – not just AWS keys.</p> <p>We are intentionally not publishing a copy-paste exploit here, to give time for security teams. In a few months, the Huntr website will publish them automatically.</p> <h3><strong>Code Execution via jinja2 templates</strong></h3> <p>Among the classes in the default <em>loads()</em> allowlist is <em>PromptTemplate</em>. This class creates a prompt from a template, and one of the available template formats is Jinja2.</p> <p>When a template is rendered with Jinja2, arbitrary Python code can run. We did not find a way to trigger this directly from the <em>loads()</em> function alone, but if a subsequent call to the deserialized object triggers rendering, code execution follows.</p> <p>We suspect there may be paths to direct code execution from <em>loads()</em>, but we have not confirmed one yet. If you have a solid idea or a lead worth testing, we’d love to hear from you – this is exactly where the security community helps turn hypotheses into proof. 🤝</p> <p>Also worth noting: in past versions, the Chain class was also in the allowlist. That class has special features that might have enabled a flow to template rendering.</p> <h2><strong>Who is affected? The practical checklist</strong></h2> <p>Your application is potentially exposed if it uses vulnerable langchain-core versions. Here are some of the most common vulnerable patterns (12 flows have been identified in total):</p> <ul> <li>astream_events(version=”v1″) (v1 uses the vulnerable serialization; v2 is not vulnerable)</li> <li>Runnable.astream_log()</li> <li>dumps() / dumpd() on untrusted data, followed by load() / loads()</li> <li>Deserializing untrusted data with load() / loads()</li> <li>Internal serialization flows like RunnableWithMessageHistory, InMemoryVectorStore.load(), certain caches, pulling manifests from LangChain Hub (hub.pull), and other listed components in the advisory</li> </ul> <p>That said, the system’s behavior is complex enough that it’s risky to assume a quick code-path review will catch every reachable variant. <strong>The safer course is to upgrade to a patched version </strong>and not assume you’re in the clear until you do.</p> <p>Also, the advisory calls out what I consider the most important real-world point:</p> <p>The most common attack vector is through LLM response fields like additional_kwargs or response_metadata, which can be controlled via prompt injection and then serialized/deserialized in streaming operations.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is exactly the kind of “AI meets classic security” intersection where organizations get caught off guard. LLM output is an untrusted input. If your framework treats portions of that output as structured objects later, you must assume attackers will try to shape it.</p> <h2><strong>Defensive guidance: how to respond in production</strong></h2> <h3><strong>1) Patch first (this is the fastest risk reduction)</strong></h3> <p>Upgrade langchain-core to a patched version. If you are using langchain, langchain-community, or other ecosystem packages, validate what version of langchain-core is actually installed in production environments.</p> <h3><strong>2) Assume LLM outputs can be attacker-shaped</strong></h3> <p>Treat additional_kwargs, response_metadata, tool outputs, retrieved documents, and message history as untrusted unless proven otherwise. This is especially important if you stream logs/events and later rehydrate them with a loader.</p> <h3><strong>3) Review deserialization features like secret resolution</strong></h3> <p>Even after upgrading, keep the principle: do not enable secret resolution from environment variables unless you trust the serialized input. The project changed defaults for a reason.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>The LangChainJS parallel</strong></h2> <p>Based on my report, there is a closely related advisory in LangChainJS (GHSA-r399-636x-v7f6 / CVE-2025-68665) with similar mechanics: ‘lc’ marker confusion during serialization, enabling secret extraction and unsafe instantiation in certain configurations.&nbsp;</p> <p>If your organization runs both Python and JavaScript LangChain stacks, treat this as a reminder that <strong>the pattern travels across ecosystems</strong>: marker-based serialization, untrusted model output, and later deserialization is a recurring risk shape.</p> <h2><strong>Why this matters beyond LangChain</strong></h2> <p>We are entering a phase where agentic AI frameworks are becoming critical infrastructure inside production systems. Serialization formats, orchestration pipelines, tool execution, caches, and tracing are no longer “plumbing” – they are part of your security boundary.</p> <p>This vulnerability is not “just a bug in a library.” It is a case study in a bigger pattern:</p> <ul> <li>Your application might deserialize data it believes it produced safely.</li> <li>But that serialized output can contain fields influenced by untrusted sources (including LLM outputs shaped by prompt injection).</li> <li>A single reserved key used as an internal marker can become a pivot point into secrets and execution-adjacent behaviors.</li> </ul> <p>At Cyata, our work is to help organizations build <strong>visibility, risk assessment, control, and governance</strong> around AI systems – because if you can’t quickly answer <em>where agents are running, which versions are deployed, and what data flows through it</em>, you’re effectively flying blind when advisories like this land.</p> <h2><strong>What this teaches us about AI governance</strong></h2> <p>If you are a security leader reading this, here is the uncomfortable truth:</p> <p>Most organizations cannot currently answer, quickly and confidently:</p> <ul> <li>Where are we using agents?</li> <li>Which versions are deployed in production?</li> <li>Which services have access to sensitive secrets?</li> <li>Where do LLM outputs cross those boundaries?</li> </ul> <p>That is not a “developer problem.” It is a visibility and governance problem.</p> <p>And that is where Cyata comes in.</p> <h2><strong>How Cyata helps: visibility, risk assessment, control, governance</strong></h2> <p>At Cyata, we focus on a practical outcome: reducing AI and agent risk without slowing down builders. Vulnerabilities like this one are rarely “just a patch.” They expose gaps in how teams discover where agents run, understand real trust boundaries, and enforce safer defaults across fast-moving frameworks.</p> <h3><strong>Visibility</strong></h3> <p>Know what is running, where, and how it is wired.</p> <p>Answer the first CVE question quickly: <strong>are we exposed, and in which flows?</strong></p> <p>Discover agent runtimes and integrations across environments (IDEs, CI, services, worker jobs, hosted agents).</p> <p>Track frameworks, packages, and versions in use.</p> <h3><strong>Risk assessment</strong></h3> <p>Prioritize what matters based on real-world blast radius, not just “library present.”</p> <p>Support faster triage: what is internet-facing, what touches secrets, what runs with elevated credentials.</p> <p>Identify the highest-risk paths: untrusted content flowing into privileged contexts (services with secrets, broad tool permissions, prod network access).</p> <p>Highlight where “structured fields” can cross trust boundaries (metadata, tool outputs, streamed events, cached artifacts).</p> <h3><strong>Control</strong></h3> <p>Reduce exposure even before every dependency is patched everywhere.</p> <p>Encourage safer operational defaults: least privilege, isolation boundaries, and policy checks that scale across teams.</p> <p>Enforce guardrails around risky patterns (for example: deserializing untrusted data, permissive object revival, unsafe streaming-to-cache-to-rehydrate flows).</p> <p>Gate or restrict sensitive capabilities in untrusted contexts (for example: secret access via environment, high-privilege tool execution, or running risky code paths in privileged workers).</p> <h3><strong>Governance</strong></h3> <p>Make “safe agent usage” repeatable, auditable, and hard to drift.</p> <ul> <li>Define policies for <strong>approved frameworks, versions, and configurations</strong>.</li> <li>Track and time-box exceptions with owners and rationale.</li> <li>Monitor for drift and risky feature usage over time, with an audit trail that supports security reviews and compliance.</li> </ul> <p>When a Christmas-week advisory drops, the goal is not heroics – it’s calm, controlled response backed by real inventory and enforced guardrails.</p> <h2><strong>Disclosure Timeline</strong></h2> <p>Report submitted via Huntr – December 4th, 2025</p> <p>Acknowledged by LangChain maintainers – December 5th, 2025&nbsp;</p> <p>Advisory and CVE published – December 24th, 2025</p> <div> <p>The Control Plane for Agentic Identity</p> </div> </div></div>"},{"id":"https://joannabregan.substack.com/p/toys-with-the-highest-play-time-and","title":"Toys with the highest play-time and lowest clean-up-time","link":"https://joannabregan.substack.com/p/toys-with-the-highest-play-time-and","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315583","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315583\">Comments</a>","date":1766078090000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false},{"id":"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/clearspace/jobs/5LtM86I-founding-network-engineer-at-clearspace","title":"Clearspace (YC W23) Is Hiring a Founding Network Engineer (VPN and Proxy)","link":"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/clearspace/jobs/5LtM86I-founding-network-engineer-at-clearspace","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46385600","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46385600\">Comments</a>","date":1766682089000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><div><div><div><p>Eliminate compulsive phone usage</p></div></div><div><h2>Founding Network Engineer at Clearspace</h2><p><span>$170K - $230K</span><span>•</span><span>0.50% - 1.00%</span><span>•</span><span>San Francisco, CA, US</span></p><div><p><strong>Skills</strong></p><p><span>Go, TypeScript, Unix</span></p></div><div><p>Connect directly with founders of the best YC-funded&nbsp;startups.</p><p><a href=\"https://account.ycombinator.com/authenticate?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.workatastartup.com%2Fapplication%3Fsignup_job_id%3D86707&amp;defaults%5BsignUpActive%5D=true&amp;defaults%5Bwaas_company%5D=28013\">Apply to role ›</a></p></div></div><h2>About the role</h2><div><p><strong>About Clearspace</strong></p> <p>Clearspace is building the intentionality layer of the internet.

And a big one. Here’s a start, anyway.</p><p>Contrary to the historically recent error of <i>sola scriptura</i>, the Bible does not interpret itself. And contrary to the modernists, it is not whatever you want it to mean.</p><p>First, what is the general nature of Scripture? It is not meant to be a scientific text. It is meant to communicate, above all, revealed truths about God that are not available to unaided reason (obviously, it also contains things we can know through unaided reason, but the <i>unique</i> value proposition is in what we cannot know by our own wits).</p><p>Historically, the tradition of knowledge, indeed the content of Scripture itself, preceded the biblical canon. You needed that tradition to make the determination of what is canonical and what is not. Similarly, you need that tradition to determine the nature of a given book: is a historical in structure, poetic, etc? This unbroken tradition, scholarship, literary analysis, etc. tell us the nature of a given text.</p><p>In the case of something like the creation accounts in Genesis (and there are two accounts, which differ), it is clear under such an examination that these are not scientific descriptions. They are written using the language of a pre-scientific culture. They do not tell us in scientific terms how the physical universe was formed. They <i>do</i> tell us that creation is <i>ex nihilo</i>, or out of nothing. (This is not a question of a big bang btw. The big bang is not necessary. It is a question of casuality. God as the Logos - eternal Reason - is the <i>per se</i> - rather than <i>per accidens</i> - cause of the universe’s existence, sustaining it in existence at every moment. God is not some Paley-style watchmaker arranging parts into a watch out of some primordial chaos, and the universe is not the result of some clash of opposing forces.) Genesis also tells us <i>that</i> there was a first human couple and that original sin can be traced to the first freely chosen immoral act. There are no binding or definitive claims about how exactly this all occurred in a historical sense. We don’t know, and as interesting as that question is [0], for the relevant purposes of the text, it doesn’t matter.</p><p>The Gospels of the New Testament, however, are very much historical in character. They are eye witness accounts of Christ’s ministry, and the canonical four were deemed to be the only reliable ones. They aren’t figurative, and the early Christians, the many witnesses of Christ’s ministry, and new evidence all align with the received and continuous tradition (indeed, one of the responsibilities of the Catholic Church is to safeguard tradition from “innovation”). Figurative interpretations of the Gospels also tend not to be compelling either, especially in light of tradition.</p><p>Obviously, biblical hermeneutics is a big topic that goes beyond an HN post. I’ve included links to a couple of texts that should introduce the material with greater depth and expertise than I can [1][2].</p><p>[0] <a href=\"http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2011/09/modern-biology-and-original-sin-part-ii.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2011/09/modern-biology-and-o...</a></p><p>[1] <a href=\"https://a.co/d/4xdAc9Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://a.co/d/4xdAc9Y</a></p><p>[2] <a href=\"https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20100930_verbum-domini.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/apost_exhorta...</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"4\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"160\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>The big bang theory isn't just \"accepted by them today,\" it has been since the beginning.

Why would it? It is not a question with any religious importance. Who cares which orb rotates around which? Copernicus wasn’t doing anything forbidden (nor had he vindicated heliocentrism) and had high ranking friends and acquaintances in the clergy (including cardinals like Cardinal Schõnberg and Pope Clement VII) who took an interest in his work. <i>De Revolutionibus</i> was itself dedicated to Pope Paul III. If anything, Copernicus was wary of other <i>academics</i> who held to the Ptolemaic view at the time. Plus ça change…</p><p>No doubt, you have in mind the oft-repeated Galileo affair which has become one of those stubborn black legends that seems to stay afloat despite the lack of facts supporting it because of its instrumental value for sticking it to the Church. The Galileo affair was not about heliocentrism. It was about a clash of egos and personalities (Galileo’s being of them, as he liked to pick pointless fights, including some nasty personal attacks on his friend and benefactor Urban VIII) that spanned decades. It isn’t as piquant as the story as typically told would have you believe.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"4\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"160\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>I'm sure there are some that think that but I was taught the earth is 10,000 years, the creation story in Genesis is the literal truth, and people spell Christmas \"Xmas\" because people are trying to take Christ out of Christmas.

These aren't fairy tales. They are a collection of books written in numerous styles and languages belonging to various genres drawn from many cultural contexts spanning thousands of years and whose canon was determined by the Catholic Church in the 4th century (most famously, at the Council of Rome when the 73 books were listed). Theologians, philosophers, and biblical scholars are deepening their understanding of this text to this day.</p><p>Just look at something like John 1:1: «In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.» Most adults aren't in a position to comprehend that, never mind a child. It is one of the most profound sentences ever uttered (those with sufficient philosophical and theological background might find this recent book on this topic of interest [0]). Or consider Exodus 3:14: «God said to Moses, “I am who I am.” And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel: ‘I am has sent me to you.’”». If that doesn't knock you off your feet, then you have not understood it. This is an incredibly sophisticated metaphysical statement, the meaning of which was unknown to the ancient pagans. (A good, short introduction from a philosophical angle can be found here [1].)</p><p>But more importantly, both you and the author of that article have committed a very basic category mistake. The Bible is not in the same business as the physical sciences. It doesn't answer the same questions. The Bible is not a scientific treatise, and the physical science are not a path to salvation from sin.</p><p>The Bible is also not a text of mere parables and life lessons. Indeed, this is one of those distinguishing features of Christianity that many fail to appreciate. In other religious traditions, it doesn't really matter where the truth claims come from or who said them. You could accept the claims without knowing or caring about the author. But you cannot do that with the figure of Christ. You cannot say \"Oh, I accept the lessons of the New Testament, I think Jesus was a wise teacher. I just don't accept his divinity or the resurrection or the miracles or all that other stuff my bourgeois sensibilities can't stomach.\" Those claims that are uniquely Christian are about Christ and rooted in the authority of Christ. It is Christ who saves - a person - not knowledge, not some method, not a technology, but a <i>person</i>. Christ calls himself the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end of all creation, eternal, the Almighty, and the source and completion of history and salvation.</p><p>That's not just some \"fun\" or \"cute\" passage. The point is that - if Christianity is true - it is through Christ that Man's relationship to God is restored <i>and elevated</i>. It is through Christ that man is ennobled. Man is invited to participate in his divinity, and unlike other traditions that maintain Man can attain divinity through his own efforts alone, the Christian says \"no\", it is not in Man's power to do that, to pull himself up by his own bootstraps; only God can do that, and the way is by answering \"yes\" to his offer, by cooperating with him so he can accomplish that divinity in us. To do that, God humbled himself through the Incarnation to share in our humanity: «the Word became flesh and dwelt among us». He entered the pathology and disorder of the world to liberate it from it, to be the path out of it.</p><p><i>That</i> is what Christianity teaches. <i>That</i> is what Christmas is about. Either that is true, or Jesus was a liar or a madman. What he wasn't was merely another \"wise teacher\". Either Christmas celebrates this momentous historical event of the Incarnation, or it is ridiculous.</p><p>[0] <a href=\"https://a.co/d/1QtQWCP\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://a.co/d/1QtQWCP</a></p><p>[1] <a href=\"https://a.co/d/bSqgkXq\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://a.co/d/bSqgkXq</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"0\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>Folks who have some extra time this Christmas, do check out the tv show Pluribus on Apple TV.

Not on the clouds, asserting his power and dominance, not with all the strength and might he rightly has. But in humility. Doing so with a profound statement that he is turning all our preconceived notions completely upside down.</p><p>One of the most beautiful, yet often overlooked, components to this story is Mary’s reaction to the news of her Son. In church tradition we call her carol The Magnificat:</p><p>“My soul exalts the Lord, and my spirit has begun to rejoice in God my Savior, because he has looked upon the humble state of his servant.</p><p>For from now on all generations will call me blessed, because he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name; from generation to generation he is merciful to those who fear him.</p><p>He has demonstrated power with his arm; he has scattered those whose pride wells up from the sheer arrogance of their hearts.</p><p>He has brought down the mighty from their thrones, and has lifted up those of lowly position; he has filled the hungry with good things, and has sent the rich away empty.</p><p>He has helped his servant Israel, remembering his mercy, as he promised to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.” (Luke 1:46-55)</p><p>Amidst all the interpretations of Christmas that we hear at this time of year from clergy, advertisers, politicians, and journalists, we might benefit from listening to the mother who sits at the centre of it all. According to Mary, Christmas is about God scattering the proud, bringing down unjust rulers, lifting up the humble. It’s about God turning things upside down— which ironically is the right way up to begin with.</p><p>And God accomplishes all of this not “from on high,” like the decree of Augustus, or the brutality of Herod; instead, God achieves his purposes from below in the lowliness of a manger. With shepherds, livestock, and foreign magi as the first witnesses.</p><p>Christmas is about God turning things upside down—which ironically is the right way up to begin with.</p><p>Every detail about the Christmas story (and the subsequent life of Jesus as well), states that God will reverse the mess and do so by first getting his own hands dirty. God conquers by humbling himself, he will heal by being wounded, he will save us by sacrificing himself. The manger is a throne, and works as a beacon of how God intends to turn everything upside down.</p><p>Grace triumphs over dominance, mercy over force, and Mary’s song will be the world’s song.</p><p>Joy will pierce through the sorrow and sadness, fully and forever.”</p><p>- Wes Huff</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"0\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>Happy winter solstice!

I've observed quite of a few of these antipatterns in the real world, but noticed that one particularly egregious (though, thankfully, rare) antipattern wasn't documented: I call it the Inner-Platform Effect. </p><p>The Inner-Platform Effect is a result of designing a system to be so customizable that it ends becoming a poor replica of the platform it was designed with. This \"customization\" of this dynamic inner-platform becomes so complicated that only a programmer (and not the end user) is able to modify it. </p><p>This Inner-Platform Effect has been seen here before (most recently in the <a href=\"https://thedailywtf.com/forums/68489/ShowPost.aspx\">Enterprise Rules Engine</a>), but it wasn't until I read <b>Mario's</b> submission that I thought it was time to name and identify the antipattern. </p><p>The loan-origination system that Mario was dragged into was designed to be revolutionary: instead of relying on a programmer to make changes to the database, a user would simply need to make a few changes via the \"Data Structure Modeler.\" I'll try to give you an idea of exactly how this ultra-dynamic storage system worked by showing a few snippets of code from the DSM: </p><blockquote> <pre>cmd.CommandText = <span>\"SELECT * FROM tblTable WHERE Name = '\"</span> + tableName + <span>\"'\"</span>; ... cmd.CommandText = <span>\"UPDATE tblFields SET DataType = '\"</span> + newDataType + <span>\"' \"</span> + <span>\" WHERE fieldId = \"</span> + fieldId.ToString(); ... cmd.CommandText = <span>\"SELECT fieldValueId, dataValue FROM tblFieldValues \"</span> + <span>\" WHERE fieldId = \"</span> + fieldId.ToString() + <span>\" ORDER BY defaultOrder\"</span>;</pre></blockquote> <p>As you may have gathered, the DSM organized data using a structure it called a \"Table\". These tables had one or more Fields, with each Field having a specific \"DataType\". A single datum was then stored as a FieldValue. All of these were stored inside of a relational database. </p><p>Ironically, Mario was brought into the system because the client wanted to add a new Field to a form. </p><p> [Advertisement] <a href=\"https://inedo.com/BuildMaster?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Self_Service&amp;utm_campaign=Buildmaster_Footer\">BuildMaster</a> allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications. <a href=\"https://inedo.com/BuildMaster/download?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Self_Service&amp;utm_campaign=Buildmaster_Footer\">Explore how!</a> </p> </div> </div></div>"},{"id":"https://www.openculture.com/2017/12/the-first-photographs-of-snowflakes.html","title":"The First Photographs of Snowflakes Discover the Groundbreaking Microphotography","link":"https://www.openculture.com/2017/12/the-first-photographs-of-snowflakes.html","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46319382","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46319382\">Comments</a>","date":1766095130000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315658","title":"Ask HN: How do I bridge the gap between PhD and SWE experiences?","link":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315658","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315658","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315658\">Comments</a>","date":1766078423000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div id=\"bigbox\"><table><tbody><tr id=\"46315658\"><td><span><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315658\">Ask HN: How do I bridge the gap between PhD and SWE experiences?</a></span></td></tr><tr><td><span><span id=\"score_46315658\">55 points</span> by <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ecophyseis\">ecophyseis</a> <span title=\"2025-12-18T17:20:23 1766078423\"><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315658\">8 hours ago</a></span> | <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/hide?id=46315658&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46315658\">hide</a> | <a href=\"https://hn.algolia.com/?query=Ask%20HN%3A%20How%20do%20I%20bridge%20the%20gap%20between%20PhD%20and%20SWE%20experiences%3F&amp;type=story&amp;dateRange=all&amp;sort=byDate&amp;storyText=false&amp;prefix&amp;page=0\">past</a> | <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/fave?id=46315658&amp;auth=b57f31e71c9b13d67988314579f102591e336f19\">favorite</a> | <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315658\">46&nbsp;comments</a></span></td></tr><tr><td><div><p>After finishing my PhD in earth sciences, I pivoted to software engineering.
