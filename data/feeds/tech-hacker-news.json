Most of my customers do.</p> <p>During a phone order one season – 2018 I believe – a customer shared this story where he smuggled some Vidalias onto his vacation cruise ship, and during each meal, would instruct the server to ‘<em>take this onion to the back, chop it up, and add it onto my salad</em> ‘. That story made me smile.</p> <p>Folks who love Vidalias, <em>love Vidalias</em>.</p> <p>Let me stop, though. I don’t want to get ahead of myself.</p> <p>How did all this start? I’m a web guy. I’m not a farmer.</p> <hr> <h2>I’M ADDICTED TO DOMAIN NAMES</h2> <p>Oddly enough, it <u>didn’t</u> start with an idea.</p> <p>Back in 2014, the domain name <a href=\"https://www.vidaliaonions.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VidaliaOnions.com</a> expired, and went up for auction. For some reason the original owner abandoned it, and being a Georgia native, I recognized it ’cause I was familiar with the industry. I’ve <a href=\"https://www.deepsouthventures.com/build-a-side-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">been buying expired or abandoned domain names</a> for a while, and enjoy developing them into niche businesses. This one was different though – I backordered the domain as a spectator, but for kicks &amp; giggles, I dropped in a bid around $2,200 ’cause I was confident I’d be outbid. </p> <p>5 minutes later, I was the proud owner of VidaliaOnions.com. I had no idea what to do with it. Ready, fire, aim.</p> <p>After the domain landed in my account, I attempted to re-focus my attention on other projects, but the name kept clawing me. Like it was saying:</p> <blockquote><p>… yoo-hoo… over here… 😘</p></blockquote> <hr> <p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/william-faulkner-bench-480.jpg\" alt=\"William faulkner statue on bench\" width=\"480\" height=\"358\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p> <p>William Faulkner had an interesting perspective on writing his characters – on how <em>they essentially wrote themselves</em>, and how <em>he</em> (Faulkner) served as a sortof mechanical in-between. His quote:</p> <blockquote><p><em>I would say to get the character in your mind. Once he is in your mind, and he is right, and he’s true, then he does the work himself. All you need to do then is to trot along behind him and put down what he does and what he says… You’ve got to know the character. You’ve got to believe in him. You’ve got to feel that he is alive… After that, the business of putting him down on paper is mechanical. <a href=\"https://faulkner.lib.virginia.edu/display/wfaudio21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[source]</a></em></p></blockquote> <p>The way Faulkner treats his characters, I treat domain name projects. I buy them with an intention to develop. And I let <u>them</u> take the lead. They’re the inspiration for the business itself. They guide me towards what they need to become. I’m just the dude behind the keyboard (sorta).</p> <p>Sometimes I buy them at auction, sometimes I buy them from original-owners. But universally, the domain name always comes first, the business idea comes second. </p> <p>I don’t usually rush into development. The path of some domains is apparent before I acquire. Others, the path reveals itself down the road. Vidalia was the latter. And after I acquired it, it kept nudging me.</p> <blockquote><p>Build me… build me… you know how. And you <em>know</em> what I should be…</p></blockquote> <p>After a month, I began to understand what it was telling me. That I buy pears from Harry &amp; David every year, and I should mimic that same service for Vidalia Onions. Instead of farm-to-door pears, farm-to-door Vidalia Onions. </p> <p>An interesting idea, but daunting to approach. I’m not a farmer, I don’t have employees, I don’t have a packing shed. And I have no logistics or distribution system setup.</p> <p>But the domain name kept staring at me. ಠ~ಠ ////<em>whispering</em>////</p> <blockquote><p>… just start …</p></blockquote> <hr> <h2>“take the path to Nothing, and go Nowhere until you reach it.”</h2><p><em>-the tao of pooh</em></p> <p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/indy-leap-faith.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"320\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p> <p>…</p> <p>And so I did. I’m just dumb enough to try a project of this complexity. The market size justified an online venture. Google Trends showed strong search volume for the phrase. And chefs around the world had already belted their praise over the ‘caviar of sweet onions’. </p> <p>So I just started down a path, with no end goal or milestone set. I just started going. No angel investor. No VC backer. I just used some modest profit from my other <a href=\"https://www.deepsouthventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">domain name developments</a> to fund the endeavor. This was Feb of 2015.</p> <p>Once I began, I discovered there was a Vidalia Onion committee which represents all the Vidalia farmers. So I reached out to them.</p> <p>They were kind enough to listen to me.</p> <p>They introduced me to several farmers in the Vidalia region.</p> <p>I got along quite well with the 3rd farmer I met (Aries Haygood), so we decided to partner &amp; give this a shot. His farm had been around for 25 years; they hadn’t focused on direct-to-consumer; but they understood its value. They operated a packing shed as well. And most importantly, they grew an award winning Vidalia. </p> <p>And so we went. </p> <p>We conservatively estimated fifty (50) orders for our 2015 season. We ended up with over six hundred (600). </p> <p>While the farm concentrated on the Vidalia, I concentrated on customer service, marketing, branding, web development, &amp; logistics. I didn’t have other projects that were this front-facing, customer wise. And I discovered I immensely enjoyed it.</p> <p>The more we both focused on these efforts, the more we grew. So much so, that other Vidalia operations began shutting down their mail order efforts and simply directed folks our way.</p> <p>We began testing alternate marketing avenues – a billboard on I-95 just south of Savannah, GA facing northbound traffic; sponsoring a bike rider headed cross country for charity; sponsoring a high school basketball team, as well as a grade school auction fundraiser. </p> <p>We added a phone order hotline, which – from time to time – generates more sales than online.</p> <p>We also made a few colossal mistakes, which were entirely of my doing, like blowing $10,000 on faulty shipping boxes from an ill-informed &amp; misleading box manufacturer in Dalton, GA. (it happened early in our journey, and nearly forced me to shut down)</p> <p>Ultimately, I refused to let something like that kill this. Honestly, my customers would be quite upset if we disappeared. Last season, while I called a gentleman back regarding a phone order, his wife answered. While I introduced myself, she interrupted me mid-sentence and hollered in exaltation to her husband: ” THE VIDALIA MAN! THE VIDALIA MAN! PICK UP THE PHONE! ”</p> <p>At that moment, I realized we were doing something right. Something helpful. Something that was making a positive impact.</p> <p>I sometimes say I prefer projects that focus on purpose over profit. And as we enter our 5th season, this one continues to do just that.</p> <p>And it’s immensely gratifying. I feel so fortunate to be associated with this industry.</p> <p>I’m Peter Askew, and I sell onions on the internet.</p> <blockquote data-lang=\"en\"> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Them: We leverage automated machine learning to enhance your existing BI visualizations with more proactive insights</p> <p>Me: I sell onions on the internet</p> <p>— Peter Askew (@searchbound) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/searchbound/status/1007015211486900229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 13, 2018</a></p></blockquote> <hr> <p>** below – from the field during harvest – these have been dug &amp; are ready for clipping<br> ( click &amp; drag )</p> <hr> <p><span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/searchbound\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Follow me on Twitter</a> as I continue to document my journey there.

I apologized for communicating performance results without noticing a compiler bug had occured.</p> <p>I can proudly say today that I am partially retracting that apology, but only for two platforms—MacOs AArch64 (XCode Clang) and Windows x86-64 (MSVC).</p> <p>In our own experiments, the tail calling interpreter for CPython was found to beat the computed goto interpreter by 5% on pyperformance on AArch64 macOS using XCode Clang, and roughly 15% on pyperformance on Windows on an experimental internal version of MSVC. The Windows build is against a switch-case interpreter, but this in theory shouldn’t matter too much, more on that in the next section.</p> <p>This is of course, a <strong>hopefully accurate</strong> result. I tried to be more diligent here, but I am of course not infallible. However, I have found that sharing early and making a fool of myself often works well, as it has led to people catching bugs in my code, so I shall continue doing so :).</p> <p>Also this assumes the change doesn’t get reverted later in Python 3.15’s development cycle.</p> <h2 id=\"brief-background-on-interpreters\">Brief background on interpreters</h2> <p>Just a recap. There are two popular current ways of writing C-based interpreters.</p> <p>Switch-cases:</p> <pre><code>switch (opcode) { case INST_1: ... case INST_2: ... } </code></pre> <p>Where we just switch-case to the correct instruction handler.</p> <p>And the other popular way is a GCC/Clang extension called labels-as-values/computed gotos.</p> <pre><code>goto *dispatch_table[opcode]; INST_1: ... INST_2: ... </code></pre> <p>Which is basically the same idea, but to instead jump to the address of the next label. Traditionally, the key optimization here is that it needs only one jump to go to the next instruction, while in the switch-case interpreter, a naiive compiler would need two jumps.</p> <p>With modern compilers however, the benefits of the computed gotos is a lot less, mainly because modern compilers have gotten better and modern hardware has also gotten better. In Nelson Elhage’s <a href=\"https://blog.nelhage.com/post/cpython-tail-call/\">excellent investigation</a> on the next kind of interpreter, the speedup of computed gotos over switch case on modern Clang was only in the low single digits on pyperformance.</p> <p>A 3rd way that was suggested decades ago, but not really entirely feasible is call/tail-call threaded interpreters. In this scheme, each bytecode handler is its own function, and we tail-call from one handler to the next in the instruction stream:</p> <div><pre><code>return dispatch_table[opcode]; PyObject *INST_1(...) { } PyObject *INST_2(...) { } </code></pre></div> <p>This wasn’t too feasible in C for one main reason—tail call optimization was merely an <em>optimization</em>. It’s something the C compiler might do, or might not do. This means if you’re unlucky and the C compiler chooses not to perform the tail call, your interpreter might stack overflow!</p> <p>Some time ago, Clang introduced <code>__attribute__((musttail))</code>, which allowed for mandating that a call <em>must</em> be tail-called. Otherwise, the compilation will fail. To my knowledge, the first time this was popularized for use in a mainstream interpreter was in <a href=\"https://blog.reverberate.org/2021/04/21/musttail-efficient-interpreters.html\">Josh Haberman’s Protobuf blog post</a>.</p> <p>Later on, Haoran Xu noticed that the GHC calling convention combined with tail calls produced efficient code. They used this for their baseline JIT in a paper and termed the technique <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3485513\">Copy-and-Patch</a>.</p> <h2 id=\"so-where-are-we-now\">So where are we now?</h2> <p>After using a fixed XCode Clang, our performance numbers on CPython 3.14/3.15 suggest that the tail calling interpreter does provide a modest speedup over computed gotos. Around the 5% geomean range on pyperformance.</p> <p>To my understanding, <code>uv</code> already ships Python 3.14 on macOS with tail calling, which might be responsible for some of the speedups you see on there. We’re planning to ship the official 3.15 macOS binaries on <code>python.org</code> with tail calling as well.</p> <p>However, you’re not here for that. The title of this blog post is clearly about MSVC Windows x86-64. So what about that?</p> <h2 id=\"tail-calling-for-windows\">Tail-calling for Windows</h2> <blockquote> <p>[!CAUTION] The features for MSVC discussed below are to my knowledge, experimental. They are not guaranteed to always be around unless the MSVC team decide to keep them. Use at your own risk!</p> </blockquote> <p>These are the preliminary pyperformance results for CPython on MSVC with tail-calling vs switch-case. Any number above 1.00x is a speedup (e.g. <code>1.01x == 1% speedup</code>), anything below 1.00x is a slowdown. The speedup is a geomtric mean of around 15-16%, with a range of ~60% slowdown (one or two outliers) to 78% speedup. However, the key thing is that the vast majority of benchmaarks sped up!</p> <p><img src=\"https://fidget-spinner.github.io/posts/media/TC-PGO-Ex3-vs-PGO.svg\" alt=\"Tailcall results\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p> <p><em>Chart credits to Michael Droettboom</em></p> <blockquote> <p>[!WARNING] These results are on an experimental internal MSVC compiler, public results below.</p> </blockquote> <p>To verify this and make sure I wasn’t wrong yet again, I checked the results on my machine with Visual Studio 2026. These are the results from <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/139922\">this issue</a>.</p> <div><pre><code>Mean +- std dev: [spectralnorm_tc_no] 146 ms +- 1 ms -&gt; [spectralnorm_tc] 98.3 ms +- 1.1 ms: 1.48x faster Mean +- std dev: [nbody_tc_no] 145 ms +- 2 ms -&gt; [nbody_tc] 107 ms +- 2 ms: 1.35x faster Mean +- std dev: [bm_django_template_tc_no] 26.9 ms +- 0.5 ms -&gt; [bm_django_template_tc] 22.8 ms +- 0.4 ms: 1.18x faster Mean +- std dev: [xdsl_tc_no] 64.2 ms +- 1.6 ms -&gt; [xdsl_tc] 56.1 ms +- 1.5 ms: 1.14x faster </code></pre></div> <p>So yeah, the speedups are real! For a large-ish library like xDSL, we see a 14% speedup, while for smaller microbenchmarks like nbody and spectralnorm, the speedups are greater.</p> <p>Thanks to Chris Eibl and Brandt Bucher, we managed to get the <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/143068\">PR for this</a> on MSVC over the finish line. I also want to sincerely thank the MSVC team. I can’t say this enough: they have been a joy to work with and I’m very impressed by what they’ve done, and I want to congratulate them on releasing Visual Studio 2026.</p> <p>This is now listed in the What’s New for 3.15 notes:</p> <blockquote> <p>Builds using Visual Studio 2026 (MSVC 18) may now use the new tail-calling interpreter. Results on an early experimental MSVC compiler reported roughly 15% speedup on the geometric mean of pyperformance on Windows x86-64 over the switch-case interpreter. We have observed speedups ranging from 15% for large pure-Python libraries to 40% for long-running small pure-Python scripts on Windows.

While I still believe that now, I suspect that is not the main reason for speedups in CPython.</p> <p>My main guess now is that <strong>tail calling resets compiler heuristics to sane levels, so that compilers can do their jobs</strong>.</p> <p>Let me show an example, at the time of writing, CPython 3.15’s interpreter loop is around <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Python/generated_cases.c.h\">12k</a> lines of C code. That’s 12k lines in a <strong>single</strong> function for the switch-case and computed goto interpreter.</p> <p>This has caused many issues for compilers in the past, too many to list in fact. I have a EuroPython 2025 talk about this. In short, this overly large function breaks a lot of compiler heuristics.</p> <p>One of the most beneficial optimisations is inlining. In the past, we’ve found that compilers sometimes straight up <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121263\">refuse</a> to inline even the simplest of functions in that 12k loc eval loop. I want to stress that this is not the fault of the compiler. It’s actually doing the correct thing—you usually don’t want to increase the code size of something already super large. Unfortunately, this does’t bode well for our interpreter.</p> <p>You might say just write the interpreter in assembly! However, the whole point of this exercise is to not do that.</p> <p>Ok enough talk, let’s take a look at the code now. Taking a real example, we examine <code>BINARY_OP_ADD_INT</code> which adds two Python integers. Cleaning up the code so it’s readable, things look like this:</p> <pre><code>TARGET(BINARY_OP_ADD_INT) { // Increment the instruction pointer. _Py_CODEUNIT* const this_instr = next_instr; frame-&gt;instr_ptr = next_instr; next_instr += 6; _PyStackRef right = stack_pointer[-1]; // Check that LHS is an int. PyObject *value_o = PyStackRef_AsPyObjectBorrow(left); if (!_PyLong_CheckExactAndCompact(value_o)) { JUMP_TO_PREDICTED(BINARY_OP); } // Check that RHS is an int. // ... (same code as above for LHS) // Add them together. PyObject *left_o = PyStackRef_AsPyObjectBorrow(left); PyObject *right_o = PyStackRef_AsPyObjectBorrow(right); res = _PyCompactLong_Add((PyLongObject *)left_o, (PyLongObject *)right_o); // If the addition fails, fall back to the generic instruction. if (PyStackRef_IsNull(res)) { JUMP_TO_PREDICTED(BINARY_OP); } // Close the references. PyStackRef_CLOSE_SPECIALIZED(left, _PyLong_ExactDealloc); PyStackRef_CLOSE_SPECIALIZED(right, _PyLong_ExactDealloc); // Write to the stack, and dispatch. stack_pointer[-2] = res; stack_pointer += -1; DISPATCH(); } </code></pre> <p>Seems simple enough, let’s take a look at the assembly for switch-case on VS 2026. Note again, this is a non-PGO build for easy source information, PGO generally makes some of these problems go away, but not all of them:</p> <pre><code> if (!_PyLong_CheckExactAndCompact(value_o)) { 00007FFC4DE24DCE mov rcx,rbx 00007FFC4DE24DD1 mov qword ptr [rsp+58h],rax 00007FFC4DE24DD6 call _PyLong_CheckExactAndCompact (07FFC4DE227F0h) 00007FFC4DE24DDB test eax,eax 00007FFC4DE24DDD je _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault+10EFh (07FFC4DE258FFh) ... res = _PyCompactLong_Add((PyLongObject *)left_o, (PyLongObject *)right_o); 00007FFC4DE24DFF mov rdx,rbx 00007FFC4DE24E02 mov rcx,r15 00007FFC4DE24E05 call _PyCompactLong_Add (07FFC4DD34150h) 00007FFC4DE24E0A mov rbx,rax ...

This X server is designed to be a modern alternative to the Xorg server.</p> <h2>Current state</h2> <p>Phoenix is not ready to be used yet. At the moment it can render simple applications that do GLX, EGL or Vulkan graphics (fully hardware accelerated) nested in an existing X server. Running Phoenix nested will be the only supported mode until Phoenix has progressed more and can run real-world applications.</p> <h2>Goals</h2> <h3>Simplicity</h3> <p>Be a simpler X server than the Xorg server by only supporting a subset of the X11 protocol, the features that are needed by relatively modern applications (applications written/updated in the last ~20 years).<br> This includes <em>all</em> software that <em>you</em> use, even old gtk2 applications.<br> Only relatively modern hardware (made/updated in the last ~15-20 years) which support linux drm and mesa gbm will be supported, and no server driver interface like the Xorg server. Just like how Wayland compositors work.</p> <h3>Security</h3> <p>Be safer than the Xorg server by parsing protocol messages automatically. As it's written in Zig, it also automatically catches illegal behaviors (such as index out of array bounds) when building with the <code>ReleaseSafe</code> option.</p> <p>Applications will be isolated from each other by default and can only interact with other applications either through a GUI prompt asking for permission,<br> such as with screen recorders, where it will only be allowed to record the window specified or by explicitly giving the application permission before launched (such as a window manager or external compositor).<br> This will not break existing clients as clients wont receive errors when they try to access more than they need, they will instead receive dummy data.<br> Applications that rely on global hotkeys should work, as long as a modifier key is pressed (keys such as ctrl, shift, alt and super).<br> If an application needs global hotkeys without pressing a modifier key then it needs to be given permissions to do so (perhaps by adding a command to run a program with more X11 permissions).<br> There will be an option to disable this to make the X server behave like the Xorg server.</p> <h3>Improvements for modern technology</h3> <p>Support modern hardware better than the Xorg server, such as proper support for multiple monitors (different refresh rates, VRR - not a single framebuffer for the whole collection of displays) and technology like HDR.</p> <h3>Improved graphics handling</h3> <p>No tearing by default and a built-in compositor. The compositor will get disabled if the user runs an external compositor (client application), such as picom or if the client runs a fullscreen application and disabled vsync in the application.<br> The goal is to also have lower vsync/compositor latency than the Xorg server.</p> <h3>New standards</h3> <p>New standards will be developed and documented, such as per-monitor DPI as randr properties. Applications can use this property to scale their content to the specified DPI for the monitor they are on.</p> <h3>Extending the X11 protocol</h3> <p>If there is a need for new features (such as HDR) then the X11 protocol will be extended.</p> <h3>Wayland compatibility</h3> <p>Some applications might only run on Wayland in the future. Such applications should be supported by either Phoenix supporting Wayland natively or by running an external application that works as a bridge between Wayland and X11 (such as 12to11).</p> <h3>Nested display server</h3> <p>Being able to run Phoenix nested under X11 or Wayland with hardware acceleration. This is not only useful for debugging Phoenix but also for developers who want to test their window manager or compositor without restarting the display server they are running.<br> Being able to run Phoenix under Wayland as an alternative Xwayland server would be a good option.</p> <h2>Non-goals</h2> <h3>Replacing the Xorg server</h3> <p>The Xorg server will always support more features of the X11 protocol and wider range of hardware (especially older ones).</p> <h3>Multiple <em>screens</em></h3> <p>Multiple displays (monitors) are going to be supported but not X11 screens.</p> <h3>Exclusive access</h3> <p>GrabServer has no effect in Phoenix.</p> <h3>Endian-swapped client/server</h3> <p>This can be reconsidered if there is a reason.</p> <h3>Indirect (remote) GLX.</h3> <p>This is very complex as there are a lot of functions that would need to be implemented. These days remote streaming options are more efficient. Alternatively a proxy for glx could be implemented that does remote rendering.</p> <h2>Differences between the X11 protocol and Phoenix</h2> <h3>Core protocol</h3> <p>Several parts of the X11 protocol (core) are mandatory to be implemented by an X server, such as many font related operations.<br> However these are not going to be implemented in Phoenix, except for the simple ones that applications actually use (such as font operations used for cursors).<br> This will not affect applications that users actually use, even if they use old gtk2 applications.</p> <h3>Strings</h3> <p>Strings are in ISO Latin-1 encoding in the X11 protocol unless specified otherwise, however in Phoenix all strings are UTF-8 unless the protocol states that it's not an ISO Latin-1 string.</p> <h2>Installing</h2> <p>Run:</p> <pre><code>zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe sudo zig build install -p /usr/local -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe </code></pre> <h2>Uninstalling</h2> <p>Zig does currently not support the uninstall command so you have to remove files manually:</p> <pre><code>sudo rm /usr/local/bin/phoenix </code></pre> <h2>Building (for development)</h2> <p>Run <code>zig build</code>, which builds Phoenix in debug mode. The compiled binary will be available at <code>./zig-out/bin/phoenix</code>. You can alternatively build and run with one command: <code>zig build run</code>.</p> <h3>Generate x11 protocol documentation</h3> <p>Run <code>zig build -Dgenerate-docs=true</code>. This will generate <code>.txt</code> files in <code>./zig-out/protocol/</code>. This generates x11 protocol documentation in the style of the official protocol documentation. The documentation is automatically generated from the protocol struct code. Note that the generated documentation feature is a work-in-progress.</p> <h2>Dependencies</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://ziglang.org/download/\">Zig 0.14.1</a></li> <li>x11 (<code>xcb</code>) - for nested mode under X11, when building Phoenix with <code>-Dbackends=x11</code></li> <li>wayland (<code>wayland-client</code>, <code>wayland-egl</code>) - for nested mode under Wayland, when building Phoenix with <code>-Dbackends=wayland</code> (not currently supported)</li> <li>drm (<code>libdrm</code>, <code>gbm</code>) - for running Phoenix as a standalone X11 server, when building Phoenix with <code>-Dbackends=drm</code> (not currently supported)</li> <li>OpenGL (<code>libglvnd</code> which provides both <code>gl</code> and <code>egl</code>)</li> </ul> <h2>FAQ</h2> <h3>Isn't it easier to write a Wayland compositor?</h3> <p>Despite popular belief, writing a simple X server that works in practice for a wide range of applications is easier to do than it is to write a Wayland compositor (+ related software).<br> Not many people have attempted to write an X server from scratch or have proper understanding of the protocol, but if you do you can see that it's quite simple.</p> </div></div>"},{"id":"https://joannabregan.substack.com/p/toys-with-the-highest-play-time-and","title":"Toys with the highest play-time and lowest clean-up-time","link":"https://joannabregan.substack.com/p/toys-with-the-highest-play-time-and","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315583","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46315583\">Comments</a>","date":1766078090000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<div dir=\"auto\"><p>The worst toy is one with many pieces that my kids dump on the ground and then play with for only 2 minutes.

We take the next exit and happen to find a Big O Tire place which is where we get most of our car work done. The transmission is seized, but it's Christmas Eve and no one is open to get an estimate on a replacement. But that's okay a couple of cousins are able to pick us up to get to the party.</p><p>We get home and find big pile of presents on our doorstep but we find they are addressed to names we don't know. So we bring them in for safekeeping. Today I look around the apartment building and finding one with a dollhouse on the balcony give a knock but its the wrong door but they knew the family which was downstairs so the right family got the presents finally.</p><p>Now cinnamon rolls are baking for breakfast and starting dinner prep soon.</p><p>But somehow I have to figure out if I should replace the transmission on a 13 year old car which needs $4500 in suspension work too or replace the whole vehicle.</p><p>And find a way to make more money since the part-time job I have right now to open up time for caregiving won't be enough for all this, and it looks like caregiving won't be necessary for much longer anyway.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"0\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><pre><code> * , _/^\\_ &lt; &gt; * /.-.\\ * * `/&amp;\\` * ,@.*;@, /_o.I %_\\ * * (`'--:o(_@; /`;--.,__ `') * ;@`o % O,*`'`&amp;\\ * (`'--)_@ ;o %'()\\ * /`;--._`''--._O'@; /&amp;*,()~o`;-.,_ `\"\"`) * /`,@ ;+&amp; () o*`;-';\\ (`\"\"--.,_0 +% @' &amp;()\\ /-.,_ ``''--....-'`) * * /@%;o`:;'--,.__ __.'\\ ;*,&amp;(); @ % &amp;^;~`\"`o;@(); * /(); o^~; &amp; ().o@*&amp;`;&amp;%O\\ jgs `\"=\"==\"\"==,,,.,=\"==\"===\"` __.----.(\\-''#####---...___...-----._ '` \\)_`\"\"\"\"\"` .--' ') o( )_-\\ `\"\"\"` `</code></pre></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"4\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"160\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>You're not expected to know the answers without doing research. <a href=\"https://britbrief.co.uk/education/schools/king-williams-college-quiz-2025-the-ultimate-test.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://britbrief.co.uk/education/schools/king-williams-coll...</a></p><p>&gt;<i>The paper carries a telling Latin motto: \"Scire ubi aliquid invenire possis ea demum maxima pars eruditionis est\" – \"To know where you can find something is, after all, the greatest part of learning.\"</i></p><p>In the modern era it is acknowledged that people will use online search engines to find the answers but hopefully we all learn something on the way</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"3\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"120\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>Woah.

These aren't fairy tales. They are a collection of books written in numerous styles and languages belonging to various genres drawn from many cultural contexts spanning thousands of years and whose canon was determined by the Catholic Church in the 4th century (most famously, at the Council of Rome when the 73 books were listed). Theologians, philosophers, and biblical scholars are deepening their understanding of this text to this day.</p><p>Just look at something like John 1:1: «In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.» Most adults aren't in a position to comprehend that, never mind a child. It is one of the most profound sentences ever uttered (those with sufficient philosophical and theological background might find this recent book on this topic of interest [0]). Or consider Exodus 3:14: «God said to Moses, “I am who I am.” And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel: ‘I am has sent me to you.’”». If that doesn't knock you off your feet, then you have not understood it. This is an incredibly sophisticated metaphysical statement, the meaning of which was unknown to the ancient pagans. (A good, short introduction from a philosophical angle can be found here [1].)</p><p>But more importantly, both you and the author of that article have committed a very basic category mistake. The Bible is not in the same business as the physical sciences. It doesn't answer the same questions. The Bible is not a scientific treatise, and the physical science are not a path to salvation from sin.</p><p>The Bible is also not a text of mere parables and life lessons. Indeed, this is one of those distinguishing features of Christianity that many fail to appreciate. In other religious traditions, it doesn't really matter where the truth claims come from or who said them. You could accept the claims without knowing or caring about the author. But you cannot do that with the figure of Christ. You cannot say \"Oh, I accept the lessons of the New Testament, I think Jesus was a wise teacher. I just don't accept his divinity or the resurrection or the miracles or all that other stuff my bourgeois sensibilities can't stomach.\" Those claims that are uniquely Christian are about Christ and rooted in the authority of Christ. It is Christ who saves - a person - not knowledge, not some method, not a technology, but a <i>person</i>. Christ calls himself the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end of all creation, eternal, the Almighty, and the source and completion of history and salvation.</p><p>That's not just some \"fun\" or \"cute\" passage. The point is that - if Christianity is true - it is through Christ that Man's relationship to God is restored <i>and elevated</i>. It is through Christ that man is ennobled. Man is invited to participate in his divinity, and unlike other traditions that maintain Man can attain divinity through his own efforts alone, the Christian says \"no\", it is not in Man's power to do that, to pull himself up by his own bootstraps; only God can do that, and the way is by answering \"yes\" to his offer, by cooperating with him so he can accomplish that divinity in us. To do that, God humbled himself through the Incarnation to share in our humanity: «the Word became flesh and dwelt among us». He entered the pathology and disorder of the world to liberate it from it, to be the path out of it.</p><p><i>That</i> is what Christianity teaches. <i>That</i> is what Christmas is about. Either that is true, or Jesus was a liar or a madman. What he wasn't was merely another \"wise teacher\". Either Christmas celebrates this momentous historical event of the Incarnation, or it is ridiculous.</p><p>[0] <a href=\"https://a.co/d/1QtQWCP\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://a.co/d/1QtQWCP</a></p><p>[1] <a href=\"https://a.co/d/bSqgkXq\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://a.co/d/bSqgkXq</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"1\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><pre><code> o / \\ o o / \\ o o / \\ o o / / \\ o o o / / \\ o o o </code></pre><p> I knew I should have invested in that fancy self-balancing one, oh well.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"2\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"80\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>Ah, don't worry.

Not on the clouds, asserting his power and dominance, not with all the strength and might he rightly has. But in humility. Doing so with a profound statement that he is turning all our preconceived notions completely upside down.</p><p>One of the most beautiful, yet often overlooked, components to this story is Mary’s reaction to the news of her Son. In church tradition we call her carol The Magnificat:</p><p>“My soul exalts the Lord, and my spirit has begun to rejoice in God my Savior, because he has looked upon the humble state of his servant.</p><p>For from now on all generations will call me blessed, because he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name; from generation to generation he is merciful to those who fear him.</p><p>He has demonstrated power with his arm; he has scattered those whose pride wells up from the sheer arrogance of their hearts.</p><p>He has brought down the mighty from their thrones, and has lifted up those of lowly position; he has filled the hungry with good things, and has sent the rich away empty.</p><p>He has helped his servant Israel, remembering his mercy, as he promised to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.” (Luke 1:46-55)</p><p>Amidst all the interpretations of Christmas that we hear at this time of year from clergy, advertisers, politicians, and journalists, we might benefit from listening to the mother who sits at the centre of it all. According to Mary, Christmas is about God scattering the proud, bringing down unjust rulers, lifting up the humble. It’s about God turning things upside down— which ironically is the right way up to begin with.</p><p>And God accomplishes all of this not “from on high,” like the decree of Augustus, or the brutality of Herod; instead, God achieves his purposes from below in the lowliness of a manger. With shepherds, livestock, and foreign magi as the first witnesses.</p><p>Christmas is about God turning things upside down—which ironically is the right way up to begin with.</p><p>Every detail about the Christmas story (and the subsequent life of Jesus as well), states that God will reverse the mess and do so by first getting his own hands dirty. God conquers by humbling himself, he will heal by being wounded, he will save us by sacrificing himself. The manger is a throne, and works as a beacon of how God intends to turn everything upside down.</p><p>Grace triumphs over dominance, mercy over force, and Mary’s song will be the world’s song.</p><p>Joy will pierce through the sorrow and sadness, fully and forever.”</p><p>- Wes Huff</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td indent=\"0\"><img src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"0\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></td><td><br> <div><p>Merry Christmas friends!

I've observed quite of a few of these antipatterns in the real world, but noticed that one particularly egregious (though, thankfully, rare) antipattern wasn't documented: I call it the Inner-Platform Effect. </p><p>The Inner-Platform Effect is a result of designing a system to be so customizable that it ends becoming a poor replica of the platform it was designed with. This \"customization\" of this dynamic inner-platform becomes so complicated that only a programmer (and not the end user) is able to modify it. </p><p>This Inner-Platform Effect has been seen here before (most recently in the <a href=\"https://thedailywtf.com/forums/68489/ShowPost.aspx\">Enterprise Rules Engine</a>), but it wasn't until I read <b>Mario's</b> submission that I thought it was time to name and identify the antipattern. </p><p>The loan-origination system that Mario was dragged into was designed to be revolutionary: instead of relying on a programmer to make changes to the database, a user would simply need to make a few changes via the \"Data Structure Modeler.\" I'll try to give you an idea of exactly how this ultra-dynamic storage system worked by showing a few snippets of code from the DSM: </p><blockquote> <pre>cmd.CommandText = <span>\"SELECT * FROM tblTable WHERE Name = '\"</span> + tableName + <span>\"'\"</span>; ... cmd.CommandText = <span>\"UPDATE tblFields SET DataType = '\"</span> + newDataType + <span>\"' \"</span> + <span>\" WHERE fieldId = \"</span> + fieldId.ToString(); ... cmd.CommandText = <span>\"SELECT fieldValueId, dataValue FROM tblFieldValues \"</span> + <span>\" WHERE fieldId = \"</span> + fieldId.ToString() + <span>\" ORDER BY defaultOrder\"</span>;</pre></blockquote> <p>As you may have gathered, the DSM organized data using a structure it called a \"Table\". These tables had one or more Fields, with each Field having a specific \"DataType\". A single datum was then stored as a FieldValue. All of these were stored inside of a relational database. </p><p>Ironically, Mario was brought into the system because the client wanted to add a new Field to a form. </p><p> [Advertisement] <a href=\"https://inedo.com/BuildMaster?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Self_Service&amp;utm_campaign=Buildmaster_Footer\">BuildMaster</a> allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications. <a href=\"https://inedo.com/BuildMaster/download?utm_source=tdwtf&amp;utm_medium=footerad&amp;utm_term=2018&amp;utm_content=Self_Service&amp;utm_campaign=Buildmaster_Footer\">Explore how!</a> </p> </div> </div></div>"},{"id":"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/issues/34271","title":"Mattermost restricted access to old messages after 10000 limit is reached","link":"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/issues/34271","hnCommentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46383675","content":"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46383675\">Comments</a>","date":1766660639000,"feedTitle":"Hacker News","isHackerNews":true,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div data-testid=\"issue-body-viewer\" data-team-hovercards-enabled=\"true\" data-turbolinks=\"false\" id=\"issue-body-viewer\"><p dir=\"auto\">We have a problem since the new upgrade.<br> \"10.000-message limit reached.

id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div id=\"content\"> <p>Posted by <strong>naruse</strong> on 25 Dec 2025</p> <p>We are pleased to announce the release of Ruby 4.0.0. Ruby 4.0 introduces “Ruby Box” and “ZJIT”, and adds many improvements.</p> <h2 id=\"ruby-box\">Ruby Box</h2> <p>Ruby Box is a new (experimental) feature to provide separation about definitions. Ruby Box is enabled when an environment variable <code>RUBY_BOX=1</code> is specified. The class is <code>Ruby::Box</code>.</p> <p>Definitions loaded in a box are isolated in the box. Ruby Box can isolate/separate monkey patches, changes of global/class variables, class/module definitions, and loaded native/ruby libraries from other boxes.</p> <p>Expected use cases are:</p> <ul> <li>Run test cases in box to protect other tests when the test case uses monkey patches to override something</li> <li>Run web app boxes in parallel to execute blue-green deployment on an app server in a Ruby process</li> <li>Run web app boxes in parallel to evaluate dependency updates for a certain period of time by checking response diff using Ruby code</li> <li>Used as the foundation (low-level) API to implement kind of “package” (high-level) API (it is not designed yet)</li> </ul> <p>For the detail of “Ruby Box”, see <a href=\"https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Ruby/Box.html\">Ruby::Box</a>. [<a href=\"https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/21311\">Feature #21311</a>] [<a href=\"https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/21385\">Misc #21385</a>]</p> <h2 id=\"zjit\">ZJIT</h2> <p>ZJIT is a new just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which is developed as the next generation of YJIT. You need Rust 1.85.0 or newer to build Ruby with ZJIT support, and ZJIT is enabled when <code>--zjit</code> is specified.</p> <p>We’re building a new compiler for Ruby because we want to both raise the performance ceiling (bigger compilation unit size and SSA IR) and encourage more outside contribution (by becoming a more traditional method compiler). See <a href=\"https://railsatscale.com/2025-12-24-launch-zjit/\">our blog post</a> for more details. <!-- the blog post will be auto-published on 2025-12-24 9:00am UTC. --></p> <p>ZJIT is faster than the interpreter, but not yet as fast as YJIT. We encourage you to experiment with ZJIT, but maybe hold off on deploying it in production for now. Stay tuned for Ruby 4.1 ZJIT.</p> <h2 id=\"ractor-improvements\">Ractor Improvements</h2> <p>Ractor, Ruby’s parallel execution mechanism, has received several improvements. A new class, <code>Ractor::Port</code>, was introduced to address issues related to message sending and receiving (see <a href=\"https://dev.to/ko1/ractorport-revamping-the-ractor-api-98\">our blog post</a>). Additionally, <code>Ractor.shareable_proc</code> makes it easier to share <code>Proc</code> objects between Ractors.</p> <p>On the performance side, many internal data structures have been improved to significantly reduce contention on a global lock, unlocking better parallelism. Ractors also now share less internal data, resulting in less CPU cache contention when running in parallel.</p> <p>Ractor was first introduced in Ruby 3.0 as an experimental feature. We aim to remove its “experimental” status next year.</p> <h2 id=\"language-changes\">Language changes</h2> <ul> <li> <p><code>*nil</code> no longer calls <code>nil.to_a</code>, similar to how <code>**nil</code> does not call <code>nil.to_hash</code>.

They protected the bit with a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.7403#page=4\">9 qubit</a> <a href=\"https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/c/quantum_repetition\">quantum repetition code</a>. The protected bit had a half life of roughly 100 microseconds. Clearly that’s not competitive with classical storage… but the goal of the experiment wasn’t to hit a high number. The goal was to perform a demonstration of the fledgling power of quantum error correction. In particular, the 9 qubit rep code had a longer lifetime than the individual physical qubits, and also a longer lifetime than the 5 qubit rep code that they also tried. It hinted that qubit quality could be solved using qubit quantity.</p> <p>Later experiments by the same group (now at Google) improved on this starting point. In 2021, it was <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06132#page=4\">a 21 qubit rep code</a> with a half life of 3 milliseconds. Then, in 2023, it was a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06431#page=5\">51 qubit rep code</a> with a half life of 300 milliseconds. Most recently, in 2024, it was a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13687#page=5\">59 qubit rep code</a> with a half life of 2 hours.</p> <p>Let’s plot this data:</p> <p><img src=\"https://algassert.com/assets/2025-12-24-qec-foom/plot-half-life-linear.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p> <p><em>(<a href=\"https://algassert.com/assets/2025-12-24-qec-foom/plot-half-life-semilog.png\">view with semilog scale instead</a>)</em></p> <p>That’s quite the plot, right? There’s a huge lull and then… FOOM! It took nearly a decade for the half life to approach one second, and then one year later it’s suddenly measured in hours?! I know why it happens, but I still find it surprising.</p> <p>Here’s a simple model that explains the FOOM. The lifetime $L$ of a repetition code grows like $L = C \\lambda^q$ (see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.0928#page=11\">equation 11 of “Surface codes: Towards practical large-scale quantum computation”</a>). Here $q$ is the number of physical qubits, $\\lambda$ is a measure of qubit quality, and $C$ is a starting constant. Suppose quality is held fixed at $\\lambda = 2$ and qubit count doubles each year (meaning $q = 2^t$). Then $L$ grows <em>superexponentially</em>:</p><p> \\[L = C \\lambda^q = C \\lambda^{2^t}\\] </p><p>The first stacked exponential is qubit count vs years, due to the assumed Moore’s-law-like growth. The second stacked exponential is error rate vs qubit count, due to technical details of how quantum error correction works that I’m not going to go into.</p> <p>What do you get when you stack two exponentials? A lull followed by a FOOM.</p> <p>In practice, things are a bit more complex than a superexponential. There are “hurdles” that place ceilings on the lifetime of error corrected objects. You discover these QEC hurdles due to the superexponential not holding, and you get mini FOOMs as you fix them. A mundane example of a QEC hurdle is, if you don’t have backup generators, your qubits can’t live longer than the time between power outages. Installing backup generators would allow the lifetime to increase, until it becomes limited by whatever the next QEC hurdle is (such as asteroid strikes).</p> <p>An important QEC hurdle is leakage. During operation, superconducting transmons can get overexcited and “leak” out of the qubit subspace. The proportion of leaked qubits will grow until they suffocate the computation. Fixing this requires some kind of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06131\">leakage removal</a>. Another important QEC hurdle is high energy events like cosmic rays. The 2023 lifetime of 300 milliseconds noticeably deviated from the $L = C \\lambda^q$ idealization, due to high energy impacts intermittently disabling the entire chip. In 2024 this problem was mitigated using <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15644\">gap engineering</a>, resulting in the sudden 10000x jump in lifetime. Without cosmic rays (or other QEC hurdles), the lifetime would have already been unmeasurably long in 2023.</p> <p>QEC hurdles are extremely important to identify and fix. In fact, this is one of the major reasons the google team does rep code experiments. To clear the way for full quantum error correction.</p> <h2 id=\"full-quantum-error-correction\">Full Quantum Error Correction</h2> <p>So far I’ve only talked about protecting a <em>classical</em> bit on a quantum chip. That only requires correcting one type of error (bit flip errors). The real goal is, of course, to protect quantum bits. Protecting a qubit requires correcting a second type of error (<a href=\"https://quantumchannelzoo.org/channel/phase-flip\">phase flip errors</a>, such as caused by unwanted measurements). Repetition codes protect against bit flips, but actually make phase flip errors worse. Correcting both simultaneously requires more complex codes, such as the <a href=\"https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/c/rotated_surface\">surface code</a>.</p> <p>Although the process of protecting a qubit is more complex than protecting a bit, the same basic dynamics are present. There’s a quality bar you must cross in order for it to work, and then you get exponential returns on error suppression by increasing qubit count. If your qubit count is also increasing exponentially, then you will achieve superexponential error suppression vs time (with ceilings as you encounter QEC hurdles).</p> <p>In a surface code, quadrupling the number of physical qubits will square the logical error rate of the protected qubit. In 2024, the best surface code experiment had a logical error rate <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13687#page=2\">of 0.1% per round</a> (corresponding to a half life of a ~300 microseconds). Holding quality constant, one qubit quadrupling would turn that 0.1% into 0.0001% (~300 milliseconds). The next quadrupling would reach 0.0000000001% (~3 days). And the one after that would reach 0.0000000000000000000001% (~30 billion years).</p> <p>Quadrupling the number of physical qubits has technical challenges, like wiring complexity, which must be overcome in a way that doesn’t degrade qubit quality. And, of course, there will be some QEC hurdle that places a ceiling stricter than 30 billion years (e.g. nuclear war). But ultimately the picture looks qualitatively similar to the rep code case. Lull… then FOOM.</p> <p>Because error corrected qubits recently begun to surpass physical qubits, I think the FOOM for logical qubits is near. I realize how ridiculous the hypotheticals look in this plot, but I legitimately think this is what will happen:</p> <p><img src=\"https://algassert.com/assets/2025-12-24-qec-foom/plot-half-life-hypothetical.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"></p> <h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2> <p>In my view, there are three long standing barriers to full scale quantum computation: qubit quality, qubit quantity, and qubit speed. I think the quality barrier will fall within the next five years. This is perhaps surprising, because the quality barrier has held strong over the three decades that we’ve known about quantum error correction. But logical qubits have recently begun surpassing physical qubits, and QEC goes FOOM.</p> </div></div>"}]}
