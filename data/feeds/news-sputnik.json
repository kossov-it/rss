This is simply impossible, because this nation here has demonstrated enough potential to lead our country on the right path,\" Maduro said at a meeting with vice presidents. Maduro added that US bets on opposition figures such as Leopoldo Lopez, Juan Guaido, and Maria Corina Machado had all failed. The US justifies its military presence in the Caribbean region by the fight against drug trafficking. Since early September, US President Donald Trump has authorized a number of strikes targeting alleged drug trafficking vessels off Venezuela's coasts. In November, Trump expressed the opinion that Maduro's days as Venezuela's leader were numbered, while saying that Washington had no plans to go to war with Caracas. Venezuela viewed these actions as a provocation aimed at destabilizing the region and as a violation of international agreements on the demilitarized and nuclear-free status of the Caribbean.</p><p>https://sputnikglobe.com/20251224/venezuela-faces-oil-bottleneck-as-us-sanctions-target-tankers-at-sea-1123353563.html</p><p>americas</p><p>venezuela</p><p>caribbean</p><div itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"><p>Sputnik International</p><p>feedback@sputniknews.com</p><p>+74956456601</p><p>MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“</p></div><p>2025</p><div itemprop=\"creator\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"><p>Sputnik International</p><p>feedback@sputniknews.com</p><p>+74956456601</p><p>MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“</p></div><p>News</p><p>en_EN</p><div itemprop=\"sourceOrganization\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"><p>Sputnik International</p><p>feedback@sputniknews.com</p><p>+74956456601</p><p>MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“</p></div><p><a itemprop=\"thumbnailUrl\" href=\"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e7/0a/11/1114259051_299:0:2852:1915_1920x0_80_0_0_29e3bd4441b8639f1d05ecc710513320.jpg\">https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e7/0a/11/1114259051_299:0:2852:1915_1920x0_80_0_0_29e3bd4441b8639f1d05ecc710513320.jpg</a></p><div itemprop=\"publisher\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"><p>Sputnik International</p><p>feedback@sputniknews.com</p><p>+74956456601</p><p>MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“</p></div><p>colonial, slave domination, impose a model of colonial and slave domination on venezuela, united states, venezuelan president nicolas maduro</p><div itemprop=\"about\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Thing\"><p>colonial, slave domination, impose a model of colonial and slave domination on venezuela, united states, venezuelan president nicolas maduro</p></div></div><div><p>BUENOS AIRES (Sputnik) - The United States will not be able to impose a model of colonial and slave domination on Venezuela to steal its natural resources, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on Saturday. </p></div><div><div data-type=\"text\"><p>\"It is impossible for the US decision-makers to fabricate a virtual reality and impose a model of colonial and slave domination on Venezuela in order to steal its natural resources.

We are fully ready on our side and expect the same approach from the other side,” Ryabkov told Russian media.At the same time, he argued that Kiev and its EU backers, who are not interested in a peaceful resolution, have stepped up efforts to derail an agreement just as the sides have drawn closer to a settlement.He also informed that a recently-circulated Ukrainian “peace plan” differs sharply from what has been discussed with the US. According to Ryabkov, the 20-point document promoted in Ukrainian media bears little resemblance to the 27-point framework worked through with Washington since early December.Addressing speculation about Ukraine’s future, Ryabkov said a scenario involving the country’s collapse is not purely theoretical, but how realistic it is remains an open question. He emphasized that developments depend on more than just the current authorities in Kiev or even public opinion, adding that Russia, as a state defending its core interests, also plays a significant role.Ryabkov rejected the idea that setting artificial deadlines could help resolve the conflict. Commenting on claims by US officials that the war could end within 90 days, he said such timelines are meaningless. “Deadlines — whether nine days or 90 — do not advance real work. What matters is addressing the substance of the issue,” he said.He also criticized claims that Russia could end the conflict immediately, calling them a cynical distortion that ignores years of explanations to Western audiences. Without resolving the underlying causes of the crisis, Ryabkov said, reaching a lasting agreement is simply not possible.</p><p>https://sputnikglobe.com/20251216/ukraines-corruption-crisis-could-nudge-zelensky-to-peace-deal--report-1123304268.html</p><p>russia</p><p>ukraine</p><div itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"><p>Sputnik International</p><p>feedback@sputniknews.com</p><p>+74956456601</p><p>MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“</p></div><p>2025</p><div itemprop=\"creator\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"><p>Sputnik International</p><p>feedback@sputniknews.com</p><p>+74956456601</p><p>MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“</p></div><p>News</p><p>en_EN</p><div itemprop=\"sourceOrganization\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"><p>Sputnik International</p><p>feedback@sputniknews.com</p><p>+74956456601</p><p>MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“</p></div><p><a itemprop=\"thumbnailUrl\" href=\"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e6/08/01/1097987754_299:0:3028:2047_1920x0_80_0_0_b2cc24715601857d22aaaf0e18cfe1e4.jpg\">https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e6/08/01/1097987754_299:0:3028:2047_1920x0_80_0_0_b2cc24715601857d22aaaf0e18cfe1e4.jpg</a></p><div itemprop=\"publisher\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"><p>Sputnik International</p><p>feedback@sputniknews.com</p><p>+74956456601</p><p>MIA „Rossiya Segodnya“</p></div><p>russia ukraine conflict, ukraine settlement talks, sergei ryabkov, russian foreign ministry, russia us negotiations, ukraine peace process, eu role in ukraine, nato ukraine crisis, ukraine war diplomacy, russia political will</p><div itemprop=\"about\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Thing\"><p>russia ukraine conflict, ukraine settlement talks, sergei ryabkov, russian foreign ministry, russia us negotiations, ukraine peace process, eu role in ukraine, nato ukraine crisis, ukraine war diplomacy, russia political will</p></div></div><div><p>December 25 was a \"turning point\" in peace talks, he said.</p></div><div><div data-type=\"text\"><p>Russia is ready to reach a settlement of the Ukraine conflict, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has said.</p></div><div data-type=\"text\"><p>However, he stressed that without addressing the root causes of the crisis, a final agreement is impossible. “The focus must be on substance. <a href=\"https://sputnikglobe.com/20251226/russia-and-us-agree-to-continue-dialogue-on-ukraine-settlement---kremlin-1123367247.html\" target=\"_blank\">We are fully ready on our side</a> and expect the same approach from the other side,” Ryabkov told Russian media.</p></div><div data-type=\"text\"><p>At the same time, he argued that Kiev and its EU backers, who are not interested in a peaceful resolution, have stepped up efforts to derail an agreement just as the sides have drawn closer to a settlement.</p></div><div data-type=\"quote\"><p>“I think December 25, 2025, will remain in our memory as a turning point, when we truly came close to a solution.
