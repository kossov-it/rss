developed a fascination with vintage Christmas ornaments and are willing to pay thousands of dollars for them. These ornaments weren’t crafted by famous designers or made from luxurious materials. But they have a history of their own and evoke nostalgia for a bygone era. </p>\n<h2>Russian holiday mood</h2>\n<p>The holiday celebrations in Russia unfold over a period of one and a half weeks. Most people are on vacation at this time, and celebrate in various ways.</p>\n<p>Orthodox Christmas (celebrated on January 7) is a religious holiday, observed in churches with traditional services and an all-night vigil. </p>\n<p>On regular days of the holiday break, Russians traditionally visit friends, host parties, or travel. Many head to Moscow, while Moscovites seek peace in the nearby suburbs. </p>\n<p>Another holiday tradition is to attend fairs, visit ice skating rinks, take part in snowball fights and participate in other fun winter activities. These are usually organized by local authorities and large businesses. </p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c585f540627d38f5ec.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>However, New Year’s Eve in Russia is primarily a family affair. It is celebrated at home with family and close friends. Russian New Year’s Eve traditions are quite simple and unpretentious. They include preparing traditional salads (like <em>“Mimosa”</em>, <em>“Herring under a fur coat”</em>, and <em>“Olivier”</em>), and writing down a wish on a piece of paper, burning the paper, pouring the ashes into a glass of champagne, and drinking it as the clock strikes midnight.</p>\n<p>For a long time, these traditions remained unchanged. Recently, though, a new trend has emerged: Soviet-era Christmas tree ornaments. Families, young enthusiasts, and collectors are on the hunt for ornaments that are 50, 70, or even 100 years old. They look for these decorations everywhere: in the homes of older relatives, in vintage and antique shops, and online. <strong><br /></strong></p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c885f540627d38f5ee.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<h2>How Christmas trees came to Russia</h2>\n<p>In Russia, the tradition of celebrating New Year on December 31 only began in 1699, following a decree of Peter the Great. Before that, September 1 marked the beginning of the new year; there was no fancy celebration  – usually the harvest was recorded and some new laws were issued on that day.</p>\n<p>However, Peter the Great introduced a new date for the celebration, along with new traditions. He ordered that homes and establishments be decorated with fir branches, which were affixed to roofs and doorways. Later, branches above doorways became a symbol of taverns in rural areas.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the 19th century that people started to put up and decorate Christmas trees, a tradition initiated by the family of Nicholas I. Eventually, festive trees found their way into the homes of aristocrats and merchants, as well as public squares. Trees were set up by December 31, but were considered Christmas trees, adorned with decorations like angels and the Star of Bethlehem.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80be85f540627d38f5e5.png\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>Initially, treats for children – apples, nuts, and candies – were hung on the trees. Later, the treats were hidden inside finely crafted ornaments – that’s how the vibrant ornaments came into existence. </p>\n<p>At first, the ornaments were imported and only the wealthy could afford them. By the end of the 19th century, however, they began to be produced in Russia, particularly around Klin, where glassblowing workshops were located. These workshops sold colorful glass balls, icicles, and figurines of angels, birds, and animals.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80bf85f540627d38f5e6.png\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<h2>Red Army soldiers replaced angels</h2>\n<p>By the time of the 1917 revolution, the tradition of decorating Christmas trees had taken hold, though it was still viewed as <em>“bourgeois.”</em> The religious significance of the Christmas tree also remained strong. This prompted the Bolsheviks, who aimed to eradicate Christian traditions, to curtail ornament production and effectively ban Christmas trees and their decorations.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c285f540627d38f5e8.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>However, the cultural war waged by the communists didn’t last long. By the 1930s, the ornaments made a comeback, albeit with a twist – reflecting the new <em>“state values.”</em> Instead of angels and the Star of Bethlehem, Soviet citizens were offered ornaments symbolizing national unity and state programs: figures of pioneers, Red Army soldiers, workers, airships, and tractors – along with figures of the country’s leaders.</p>\n<p>Popular magazines published patterns for homemade ornaments. These were also patriotic, of course.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d7db9203027402645b754.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>During the Second World War, the industry only operated for military needs, so ornaments were crafted from available materials like cotton, cardboard, and foil.

However, there is one notable exception: Christmas tree ornaments. They aren’t just appreciated by the young and old alike – they have become a real trend. </p>\n<p>This year alone, demand for such ornaments surged 80%.
