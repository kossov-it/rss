developed a fascination with vintage Christmas ornaments and are willing to pay thousands of dollars for them. These ornaments weren’t crafted by famous designers or made from luxurious materials. But they have a history of their own and evoke nostalgia for a bygone era. </p>\n<h2>Russian holiday mood</h2>\n<p>The holiday celebrations in Russia unfold over a period of one and a half weeks. Most people are on vacation at this time, and celebrate in various ways.</p>\n<p>Orthodox Christmas (celebrated on January 7) is a religious holiday, observed in churches with traditional services and an all-night vigil. </p>\n<p>On regular days of the holiday break, Russians traditionally visit friends, host parties, or travel. Many head to Moscow, while Moscovites seek peace in the nearby suburbs. </p>\n<p>Another holiday tradition is to attend fairs, visit ice skating rinks, take part in snowball fights and participate in other fun winter activities. These are usually organized by local authorities and large businesses. </p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c585f540627d38f5ec.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>However, New Year’s Eve in Russia is primarily a family affair. It is celebrated at home with family and close friends. Russian New Year’s Eve traditions are quite simple and unpretentious. They include preparing traditional salads (like <em>“Mimosa”</em>, <em>“Herring under a fur coat”</em>, and <em>“Olivier”</em>), and writing down a wish on a piece of paper, burning the paper, pouring the ashes into a glass of champagne, and drinking it as the clock strikes midnight.</p>\n<p>For a long time, these traditions remained unchanged. Recently, though, a new trend has emerged: Soviet-era Christmas tree ornaments. Families, young enthusiasts, and collectors are on the hunt for ornaments that are 50, 70, or even 100 years old. They look for these decorations everywhere: in the homes of older relatives, in vintage and antique shops, and online. <strong><br /></strong></p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c885f540627d38f5ee.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<h2>How Christmas trees came to Russia</h2>\n<p>In Russia, the tradition of celebrating New Year on December 31 only began in 1699, following a decree of Peter the Great. Before that, September 1 marked the beginning of the new year; there was no fancy celebration  – usually the harvest was recorded and some new laws were issued on that day.</p>\n<p>However, Peter the Great introduced a new date for the celebration, along with new traditions. He ordered that homes and establishments be decorated with fir branches, which were affixed to roofs and doorways. Later, branches above doorways became a symbol of taverns in rural areas.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the 19th century that people started to put up and decorate Christmas trees, a tradition initiated by the family of Nicholas I. Eventually, festive trees found their way into the homes of aristocrats and merchants, as well as public squares. Trees were set up by December 31, but were considered Christmas trees, adorned with decorations like angels and the Star of Bethlehem.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80be85f540627d38f5e5.png\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>Initially, treats for children – apples, nuts, and candies – were hung on the trees. Later, the treats were hidden inside finely crafted ornaments – that’s how the vibrant ornaments came into existence. </p>\n<p>At first, the ornaments were imported and only the wealthy could afford them. By the end of the 19th century, however, they began to be produced in Russia, particularly around Klin, where glassblowing workshops were located. These workshops sold colorful glass balls, icicles, and figurines of angels, birds, and animals.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80bf85f540627d38f5e6.png\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<h2>Red Army soldiers replaced angels</h2>\n<p>By the time of the 1917 revolution, the tradition of decorating Christmas trees had taken hold, though it was still viewed as <em>“bourgeois.”</em> The religious significance of the Christmas tree also remained strong. This prompted the Bolsheviks, who aimed to eradicate Christian traditions, to curtail ornament production and effectively ban Christmas trees and their decorations.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c285f540627d38f5e8.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>However, the cultural war waged by the communists didn’t last long. By the 1930s, the ornaments made a comeback, albeit with a twist – reflecting the new <em>“state values.”</em> Instead of angels and the Star of Bethlehem, Soviet citizens were offered ornaments symbolizing national unity and state programs: figures of pioneers, Red Army soldiers, workers, airships, and tractors – along with figures of the country’s leaders.</p>\n<p>Popular magazines published patterns for homemade ornaments. These were also patriotic, of course.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d7db9203027402645b754.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>During the Second World War, the industry only operated for military needs, so ornaments were crafted from available materials like cotton, cardboard, and foil.

This led to the emergence of a recognizable Soviet ornament style in the 1950s, featuring bright, colorful balls, pine cones, icicles, and fairy tale characters.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c085f540627d38f5e7.png\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<h2>Why the Soviet look still divides Russians</h2>\n<p>Today, Russian people don’t have a single opinion about Soviet aesthetics.

Even the drab Soviet panel buildings have their fans, who affectionately refer to them as <em>“panelki.”</em></p>\n<p>Images of the <em>“Soviet future”</em> remain particularly appealing; mosaics depicting cosmonauts and posters showcasing proud workers and soldiers continue to inspire people. </p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c485f540627d38f5eb.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>However, daily life during the communist era is generally viewed as outdated. Soviet interiors are often criticized for their clunky design, commonly dubbed <em>“grandma’s renovation.”</em></p>\n<p>Items from everyday life in the USSR only interest collectors and museums. However, there is one notable exception: Christmas tree ornaments. They aren’t just appreciated by the young and old alike – they have become a real trend. </p>\n<p>This year alone, demand for such ornaments surged 80%. Prices for rare sets and even individual ornaments can reach up to 1.5 million rubles ($19,000).

What they are getting instead is a massive redaction campaign.</p>\n<p>Not since 1998 with the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton%E2%80%93Lewinsky_scandal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">show trial</a> has the American public been so incensed by a sex scandal like the one the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein personally directed for many years. Here is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to send not just one or two powerful ‘untouchables’ to prison for the worst crime imaginable – sexual abuse of a minor – but many dozens, possibly hundreds. In other words, a vast network of international power, wealth, and systemic abuse.</p>\n<p>Yet today we are no closer to the truth as to the identities of the sick perpetrators. Under the bipartisan Epstein Files Transparency Act, the Justice Department was required to release all of its investigative material on Mr. Epstein by Dec. 19, though it was allowed to redact and withhold certain material in order to <em>“protect the victims,”</em> which is of course understandable. It also withheld materials that would <em>“jeopardize a federal investigation.”</em> Whether we’ll actually see a single suspect face trial is presently unknown, but the DOJ took full advantage of that loophole as <a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/doj-misses-deadline-full-epstein-files-release-will-instead-stagger-protect-victims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">680 pages of the release</a> were entirely redacted, which made the release practically redundant and senseless.</p>\n<p>Were we the people once again expecting too much from the government?

An interim government, which has been in power since the ouster of ex-Prime Minister Hasina in August 2024, has delayed the announcement of elections for months and has finally set the date for the polls as February 12, under pressure from various political forces.
