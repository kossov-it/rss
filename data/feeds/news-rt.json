Students paid more, pensioners got squeezed, and social housing dried up.

Safety came a distant second. Apologies came much later – long after the government and special interests in oil and gas had pocketed the cash, which the inquiry said was facilitated by all the <a href=\"https://nltimes.nl/2022/09/06/dutch-state-earned-eu3637-billion-groningen-gas-extraction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">singing and dancing</a> that Rutte was doing about the need for security at all cost. <a href=\"https://nltimes.nl/2022/09/06/dutch-state-earned-eu3637-billion-groningen-gas-extraction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>Sound familiar? Only back then, it was energy security, not national security and defense using Russia as a convenient bogeyman.</p>\n<p>And speaking of a lack of transparency, it turns out that was only Rutte’s first rodeo. Later, Rutte admitted that he routinely <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/nokiagate-lawmakers-mark-rutte-pm-deleted-texts-for-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deleted</a> the text messages off his government phone that were both sensitive and political. Some involved squabbling with the mayor of Amsterdam over whether Black Lives Matter-type protests should supersede the dystopian Covid-era 1.5 meter social distancing rule. <a href=\"https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/politiek/artikel/5309707/rutte-gepikeerd-als-er-geen-vertrouwen-ga-ik-anders-dingen-doen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>Others were with the CEO of multinational Unilever about tax matters.</p>\n<p>The opposition <a href=\"https://www.brusselstimes.com/226179/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-blasted-for-deleted-messages-in-nokiagate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a> that Rutte wiping his hard drive on a daily basis with all the nonchalance of cleaning the coffee machine was a great way to avoid all accountability around archiving laws. Particularly when that accountability exists almost exclusively in text message form on your government phone and server. Which brings us to Rutte’s signature phrase.</p>\n<p>During government coalition talks in 2021, Rutte repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/mark-rutte-becomes-netherlands-longest-serving-prime-minister\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">claimed</a> that he had <em>“no active memory”</em> of key discussions – even when paperwork suggested otherwise. 'No active memory' became his unofficial slogan. <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/mark-rutte-becomes-netherlands-longest-serving-prime-minister/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>Bolstered by his highly selective memory, Dutch media nicknamed him 'Teflon Mark,' because nothing stuck – except maybe the job that he should have been kicked out of several scandals ago.</p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/thumbnail/6945497d2030277c0c5fad03.jpg\" alt=\"NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Brussels, Belgium, December 3, 2025.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/russia/629765-putin-rutte-smart-man/\">NATO chief is a ‘smart man spouting nonsense’ – Putin</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    \n\n<p>If all this isn’t quite dramatic enough, then why not also spill some unnecessary details about your private life, too? In Europe, no one really cares much about people’s personal lives, but Rutte has long insisted on regaling the public with ambiguities around his anyway. Even before he became prime minister, he openly <a href=\"https://www.dutchnews.nl/2011/05/press_office_request_awakens_i/#:~:text=May%2018%2C%202011,have%20now%20been%20published%20again\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wished</a> that he were a thirst trap, specifically bisexual, because <em>“then the whole world is after you.”</em> <a href=\"https://www.dutchnews.nl/2011/05/press_office_request_awakens_i/#:~:text=May%2018%2C%202011,have%20now%20been%20published%20again.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>He also riffed about walking around naked at home. Way to turn your political origin story into some kind of kinky art house movie.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on the world stage, he seems to be just as thirsty. At Ukrainian peace negotiations in Istanbul over the summer, Rutte complained that Russia had sent a historian as part of its delegation, basically accusing him of using Russian history going back to the 13th century to filibuster the peace talks.</p>\n<p>Moscow was quick to point out that the EU also sent a historian – one whose insights could best be described as bargain basement. Wonder why Rutte didn’t notice, despite being in attendance? Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has a hunch: <em>“Mr. Rutte himself is also a historian. But at the same time, I never heard brilliant historical parallels from him.”</em></p>\n<p>And finally, the moment that turned the NATO secretary-general into a meme, and arguably also a household name for a few days. <em>“Sometimes daddy has to use strong words,”</em> Rutte said to US President Donald Trump during a press event, referring to Trump’s public rants on global affairs.</p>\n<p>Well, that was all it took for social media to light up like it was Christmas. Including one of its top trolls: Trump himself. <em>“I think he likes me. He said it very affectionately: ‘Hey daddy, you’re my daddy,”</em> Trump said of Rutte.</p>\n<p>So this is the same guy who’s now warning Europe about repeating history: famous for deleting messages, forgetting conversations, surviving resignations, and never quite being pinned down on anything – even as he stirs up gratuitous speculation and drama, not just about Russia, but also about himself, personally.</p>\n<p>When the dust settles on all this warmongering rhetoric, and the costs from this tsunami of threat inflation come due – if history is any indication, then Rutte the historian probably won’t remember anything.</p>","date":1766760042000,"feedTitle":"RT","isHackerNews":false,"isGoogleNews":false,"fullContent":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><p> Mark Rutte is trying to invoke history against Russia – bold move for someone with such a selective memory of his own scandals </p><div><p>NATO boss, Mark Rutte, says that Western Europe could be heading toward a war with Russia <em>“like our grandparents experienced.”</em> Which implies that he has a phenomenal memory of World War II, 80 years ago.

(Spoiler alert: he didn’t.)</p><p>Later, a <a href=\"https://nltimes.nl/2019/03/05/parliamentary-inquiry-groningen-gas-extraction-announced\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">parliamentary investigation</a> found that the state prioritized gas revenue while taking most of the profit. Safety came a distant second. Apologies came much later – long after the government and special interests in oil and gas had pocketed the cash, which the inquiry said was facilitated by all the <a href=\"https://nltimes.nl/2022/09/06/dutch-state-earned-eu3637-billion-groningen-gas-extraction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">singing and dancing</a> that Rutte was doing about the need for security at all cost.&nbsp;Sound familiar? Only back then, it was energy security, not national security and defense using Russia as a convenient bogeyman.</p><p>And speaking of a lack of transparency, it turns out that was only Rutte’s first rodeo. Later, Rutte admitted that he routinely <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/nokiagate-lawmakers-mark-rutte-pm-deleted-texts-for-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deleted</a> the text messages off his government phone that were both sensitive and political. Some involved squabbling with the mayor of Amsterdam over whether Black Lives Matter-type protests should supersede the dystopian Covid-era 1.5 meter social distancing rule.&nbsp;Others were with the CEO of multinational Unilever about tax matters.</p><p>The opposition <a href=\"https://www.brusselstimes.com/226179/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-blasted-for-deleted-messages-in-nokiagate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a>&nbsp;that Rutte wiping his hard drive on a daily basis with all the nonchalance of cleaning the coffee machine was a great way to avoid all accountability around archiving laws. Particularly when that accountability exists almost exclusively in text message form on your government phone and server. Which brings us to Rutte’s signature phrase.</p><p>During government coalition talks in 2021, Rutte repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/mark-rutte-becomes-netherlands-longest-serving-prime-minister\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">claimed</a> that he had <em>“no active memory”</em> of key discussions – even when paperwork suggested otherwise. 'No active memory' became his unofficial slogan.&nbsp;Bolstered by his highly selective memory, Dutch media nicknamed him 'Teflon Mark,' because nothing stuck – except maybe the job that he should have been kicked out of several scandals ago.</p><div data-has-alias=\"\"> <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/russia/629765-putin-rutte-smart-man/\" target=\"_blank\"> <picture> <!--[if IE 9]> <video style=\"display: none;\"><![endif]--> <source media=\"(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" data-srcset=\" https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/xxs/6945497d2030277c0c5fad04.jpg 560w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/xs/6945497e2030277c0c5fad05.jpg 640w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/thumbnail/6945497d2030277c0c5fad03.jpg 920w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/m/6945497f2030277c0c5fad06.jpg 1080w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/l/6945497f2030277c0c5fad07.jpg 1536w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/article/6945497c2030277c0c5fad02.jpg 1960w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/xxl/694549802030277c0c5fad08.jpg 2480w \" srcset=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAQAAACRI2S5AAAAEElEQVR42mNkIAAYRxWAAQAG9gAKqv6+AwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\"> <source data-srcset=\" https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/xxs/6945497d2030277c0c5fad04.jpg 280w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/xs/6945497e2030277c0c5fad05.jpg 320w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/thumbnail/6945497d2030277c0c5fad03.jpg 460w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/m/6945497f2030277c0c5fad06.jpg 540w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/l/6945497f2030277c0c5fad07.jpg 768w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/article/6945497c2030277c0c5fad02.jpg 980w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/xxl/694549802030277c0c5fad08.jpg 1240w \" srcset=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAQAAACRI2S5AAAAEElEQVR42mNkIAAYRxWAAQAG9gAKqv6+AwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\"> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"NATO chief is a ‘smart man spouting nonsense’ – Putin\" data-sizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/xxs/6945497d2030277c0c5fad04.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"> </picture> <!-- noscript pattern --> </a> </div> <p>If all this isn’t quite dramatic enough, then why not also spill some unnecessary details about your private life, too? In Europe, no one really cares much about people’s personal lives, but Rutte has long insisted on regaling the public with ambiguities around his anyway. Even before he became prime minister, he openly <a href=\"https://www.dutchnews.nl/2011/05/press_office_request_awakens_i/#:~:text=May%2018%2C%202011,have%20now%20been%20published%20again\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wished</a> that he were a thirst trap, specifically bisexual, because <em>“then the whole world is after you.”</em>&nbsp;He also riffed about walking around naked at home. Way to turn your political origin story into some kind of kinky art house movie.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the world stage, he seems to be just as thirsty. At Ukrainian peace negotiations in Istanbul over the summer, Rutte complained that Russia had sent a historian as part of its delegation, basically accusing him of using Russian history going back to the 13th century to filibuster the peace talks.</p><p>Moscow was quick to point out that the EU also sent a historian – one whose insights could best be described as bargain basement. Wonder why Rutte didn’t notice, despite being in attendance? Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has a hunch: <em>“Mr. Rutte himself is also a historian. But at the same time, I never heard brilliant historical parallels from him.”</em></p><p>And finally, the moment that turned the NATO secretary-general into a meme, and arguably also a household name for a few days. <em>“Sometimes daddy has to use strong words,”</em> Rutte said to US President Donald Trump during a press event, referring to Trump’s public rants on global affairs.</p><p>Well, that was all it took for social media to light up like it was Christmas. Including one of its top trolls: Trump himself. <em>“I think he likes me. He said it very affectionately: ‘Hey daddy, you’re my daddy,”</em> Trump said of Rutte.</p><p>So this is the same guy who’s now warning Europe about repeating history: famous for deleting messages, forgetting conversations, surviving resignations, and never quite being pinned down on anything – even as he stirs up gratuitous speculation and drama, not just about Russia, but also about himself, personally.</p><p>When the dust settles on all this warmongering rhetoric, and the costs from this tsunami of threat inflation come due – if history is any indication, then Rutte the historian probably won’t remember anything.</p></div><p>The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.</p></div>"},{"id":"https://www.rt.com/africa/630055-nigeria-comments-us-airstrikes/","title":"Nigeria comments on US airstrikes","link":"https://www.rt.com/africa/630055-nigeria-comments-us-airstrikes/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS","hnCommentsUrl":null,"content":"\n                            <p><strong>According to officials in Abuja, the military operation in Sokoto state was conducted in line with international law</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>US airstrikes targeting Islamist terrorist organizations in northwestern Nigeria were conducted as part of <em>“structured”</em> security cooperation with Washington, the West African country’s government has confirmed.

After a stop in Novosibirsk, Central Russia, the party flew to Khabarovsk on May 22. The manifest for the flight included Clinton, his aide Doug Band, and several others. The group then reportedly proceeded to Shenzhen, China.</p>\n<p>A subsequent trip in November 2002 included a flight attendant and involved stops in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
