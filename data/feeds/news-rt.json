Christmas ornaments","link":"https://www.rt.com/russia/630011-grandmas-toys-are-cool-again/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS","hnCommentsUrl":null,"content":"\n                            <p><strong>How communist-era tree toys became status symbols, family heirlooms, and million-ruble collectibles</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>Russians have developed a fascination with vintage Christmas ornaments and are willing to pay thousands of dollars for them. These ornaments weren’t crafted by famous designers or made from luxurious materials. But they have a history of their own and evoke nostalgia for a bygone era. </p>\n<h2>Russian holiday mood</h2>\n<p>The holiday celebrations in Russia unfold over a period of one and a half weeks. Most people are on vacation at this time, and celebrate in various ways.</p>\n<p>Orthodox Christmas (celebrated on January 7) is a religious holiday, observed in churches with traditional services and an all-night vigil. </p>\n<p>On regular days of the holiday break, Russians traditionally visit friends, host parties, or travel. Many head to Moscow, while Moscovites seek peace in the nearby suburbs. </p>\n<p>Another holiday tradition is to attend fairs, visit ice skating rinks, take part in snowball fights and participate in other fun winter activities. These are usually organized by local authorities and large businesses. </p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c585f540627d38f5ec.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>However, New Year’s Eve in Russia is primarily a family affair. It is celebrated at home with family and close friends. Russian New Year’s Eve traditions are quite simple and unpretentious. They include preparing traditional salads (like <em>“Mimosa”</em>, <em>“Herring under a fur coat”</em>, and <em>“Olivier”</em>), and writing down a wish on a piece of paper, burning the paper, pouring the ashes into a glass of champagne, and drinking it as the clock strikes midnight.</p>\n<p>For a long time, these traditions remained unchanged. Recently, though, a new trend has emerged: Soviet-era Christmas tree ornaments. Families, young enthusiasts, and collectors are on the hunt for ornaments that are 50, 70, or even 100 years old. They look for these decorations everywhere: in the homes of older relatives, in vintage and antique shops, and online. <strong><br /></strong></p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c885f540627d38f5ee.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<h2>How Christmas trees came to Russia</h2>\n<p>In Russia, the tradition of celebrating New Year on December 31 only began in 1699, following a decree of Peter the Great. Before that, September 1 marked the beginning of the new year; there was no fancy celebration  – usually the harvest was recorded and some new laws were issued on that day.</p>\n<p>However, Peter the Great introduced a new date for the celebration, along with new traditions. He ordered that homes and establishments be decorated with fir branches, which were affixed to roofs and doorways. Later, branches above doorways became a symbol of taverns in rural areas.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the 19th century that people started to put up and decorate Christmas trees, a tradition initiated by the family of Nicholas I. Eventually, festive trees found their way into the homes of aristocrats and merchants, as well as public squares. Trees were set up by December 31, but were considered Christmas trees, adorned with decorations like angels and the Star of Bethlehem.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80be85f540627d38f5e5.png\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>Initially, treats for children – apples, nuts, and candies – were hung on the trees. Later, the treats were hidden inside finely crafted ornaments – that’s how the vibrant ornaments came into existence. </p>\n<p>At first, the ornaments were imported and only the wealthy could afford them. By the end of the 19th century, however, they began to be produced in Russia, particularly around Klin, where glassblowing workshops were located. These workshops sold colorful glass balls, icicles, and figurines of angels, birds, and animals.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80bf85f540627d38f5e6.png\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<h2>Red Army soldiers replaced angels</h2>\n<p>By the time of the 1917 revolution, the tradition of decorating Christmas trees had taken hold, though it was still viewed as <em>“bourgeois.”</em> The religious significance of the Christmas tree also remained strong. This prompted the Bolsheviks, who aimed to eradicate Christian traditions, to curtail ornament production and effectively ban Christmas trees and their decorations.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c285f540627d38f5e8.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>However, the cultural war waged by the communists didn’t last long. By the 1930s, the ornaments made a comeback, albeit with a twist – reflecting the new <em>“state values.”</em> Instead of angels and the Star of Bethlehem, Soviet citizens were offered ornaments symbolizing national unity and state programs: figures of pioneers, Red Army soldiers, workers, airships, and tractors – along with figures of the country’s leaders.</p>\n<p>Popular magazines published patterns for homemade ornaments. These were also patriotic, of course.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d7db9203027402645b754.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>During the Second World War, the industry only operated for military needs, so ornaments were crafted from available materials like cotton, cardboard, and foil. Hospitals used empty medicine vials – painting them, attaching wires, and hanging them for patients to enjoy. </p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c385f540627d38f5ea.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>Factories repurposed scraps – wires, metal shavings, and defective parts – into decorations like snowflakes, flowers, and five-pointed red stars.</p>\n<p>After the war, the production of ornaments resumed. The authorities no longer sought to create a <em>“new Soviet person”</em> and started to ease regulations on home aesthetics. This led to the emergence of a recognizable Soviet ornament style in the 1950s, featuring bright, colorful balls, pine cones, icicles, and fairy tale characters.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c085f540627d38f5e7.png\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<h2>Why the Soviet look still divides Russians</h2>\n<p>Today, Russian people don’t have a single opinion about Soviet aesthetics. Some like monumental Brutalist architecture, the uniforms of Komsomol members, and Soviet automobiles. Even the drab Soviet panel buildings have their fans, who affectionately refer to them as <em>“panelki.”</em></p>\n<p>Images of the <em>“Soviet future”</em> remain particularly appealing; mosaics depicting cosmonauts and posters showcasing proud workers and soldiers continue to inspire people. </p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c485f540627d38f5eb.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>However, daily life during the communist era is generally viewed as outdated. Soviet interiors are often criticized for their clunky design, commonly dubbed <em>“grandma’s renovation.”</em></p>\n<p>Items from everyday life in the USSR only interest collectors and museums. However, there is one notable exception: Christmas tree ornaments. They aren’t just appreciated by the young and old alike – they have become a real trend. </p>\n<p>This year alone, demand for such ornaments surged 80%. Prices for rare sets and even individual ornaments can reach up to 1.5 million rubles ($19,000). Not only antique dealers but also fashionistas proudly showcase their vintage Christmas ornaments. </p>\n<p>And it’s not just a matter of nostalgia. </p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d7cae20302743fa2a4cfd.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<h2>Fashion, money, family</h2>\n<p>Vintage and retro trends are taking hold across Russia. While Soviet-era clothes, furniture, and appliances may not appeal to everyone, Christmas ornaments offer a taste of history without any discomfort. These aren’t modern copies, they are tangible pieces of the past that can be appreciated and used as intended.</p>\n<p>The growing popularity of Soviet ornaments is also driven by their scarcity. The supply is limited: many ornaments have long been broken, while others lie forgotten in dusty boxes in attics and basements. The original production was never mass-scale, and a significant number of these ornaments were handcrafted, making them truly unique. Experts already recognize Soviet Christmas ornaments as valuable antiques.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694d80c385f540627d38f5e9.jpg\"  />\n            </figure>\n\n<p>Additionally, there has been a shift in attitudes toward the Soviet past. After the collapse of the USSR, discussions of life under communism – whether in film, media, or literature – became highly politicized. Some idealized this era, while others portrayed it as a dystopia. Debates grew heated, even among those who simply appreciated Soviet aesthetics. </p>\n<p>Over time, even Russians with strong opinions about the USSR became weary of emotional arguments.

These ornaments weren’t crafted by famous designers or made from luxurious materials. But they have a history of their own and evoke nostalgia for a bygone era.&nbsp;</p><h2>Russian holiday mood</h2><p>The holiday celebrations in Russia unfold over a period of one and a half weeks. Most people are on vacation at this time, and celebrate in various ways.</p><p>Orthodox Christmas (celebrated on January 7) is a religious holiday, observed in churches with traditional services and an all-night vigil.&nbsp;</p><p>On regular days of the holiday break, Russians traditionally visit friends, host parties, or travel. Many head to Moscow, while Moscovites seek peace in the nearby suburbs.&nbsp;</p><p>Another holiday tradition is to attend fairs, visit ice skating rinks, take part in snowball fights and participate in other fun winter activities. These are usually organized by local authorities and large businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>However, New Year’s Eve in Russia is primarily a family affair. It is celebrated at home with family and close friends. Russian New Year’s Eve traditions are quite simple and unpretentious. They include preparing traditional salads (like <em>“Mimosa”</em>, <em>“Herring under a fur coat”</em>, and <em>“Olivier”</em>), and writing down a wish on a piece of paper, burning the paper, pouring the ashes into a glass of champagne, and drinking it as the clock strikes midnight.</p><p>For a long time, these traditions remained unchanged. Recently, though, a new trend has emerged: Soviet-era Christmas tree ornaments. Families, young enthusiasts, and collectors are on the hunt for ornaments that are 50, 70, or even 100 years old. They look for these decorations everywhere: in the homes of older relatives, in vintage and antique shops, and online.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p><h2>How Christmas trees came to Russia</h2><p>In Russia, the tradition of celebrating New Year on December 31 only began in 1699, following a decree of Peter the Great. Before that, September 1 marked the beginning of the new year; there was no fancy celebration&nbsp; – usually the harvest was recorded and some new laws were issued on that day.</p><p>However, Peter the Great introduced a new date for the celebration, along with new traditions. He ordered that homes and establishments be decorated with fir branches, which were affixed to roofs and doorways. Later, branches above doorways became a symbol of taverns in rural areas.</p><p>It wasn’t until the 19th century that people started to put up and decorate Christmas trees, a tradition initiated by the family of Nicholas I. Eventually, festive trees found their way into the homes of aristocrats and merchants, as well as public squares. Trees were set up by December 31, but were considered Christmas trees, adorned with decorations like angels and the Star of Bethlehem.</p><p>Initially, treats for children – apples, nuts, and candies – were hung on the trees. Later, the treats were hidden inside finely crafted ornaments – that’s how the vibrant ornaments came into existence.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, the ornaments were imported and only the wealthy could afford them. By the end of the 19th century, however, they began to be produced in Russia, particularly around Klin, where glassblowing workshops were located. These workshops sold colorful glass balls, icicles, and figurines of angels, birds, and animals.</p><h2>Red Army soldiers replaced angels</h2><p>By the time of the 1917 revolution, the tradition of decorating Christmas trees had taken hold, though it was still viewed as <em>“bourgeois.”</em> The religious significance of the Christmas tree also remained strong. This prompted the Bolsheviks, who aimed to eradicate Christian traditions, to curtail ornament production and effectively ban Christmas trees and their decorations.</p><p>However, the cultural war waged by the communists didn’t last long. By the 1930s, the ornaments made a comeback, albeit with a twist – reflecting the new <em>“state values.”</em>&nbsp;Instead of angels and the Star of Bethlehem, Soviet citizens were offered ornaments symbolizing national unity and state programs: figures of pioneers, Red Army soldiers, workers, airships, and tractors – along with figures of the country’s leaders.</p><p>Popular magazines published patterns for homemade ornaments. These were also patriotic, of course.</p><p>During the Second World War, the industry only operated for military needs, so ornaments were crafted from available materials like cotton, cardboard, and foil. Hospitals used empty medicine vials – painting them, attaching wires, and hanging them for patients to enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>Factories repurposed scraps – wires, metal shavings, and defective parts – into decorations like snowflakes, flowers, and five-pointed red stars.</p><p>After the war, the production of ornaments resumed. The authorities no longer sought to create a <em>“new Soviet person”</em> and started to ease regulations on home aesthetics. This led to the emergence of a recognizable Soviet ornament style in the 1950s, featuring bright, colorful balls, pine cones, icicles, and fairy tale characters.</p><h2>Why the Soviet look still divides Russians</h2><p>Today, Russian people don’t have a single opinion about Soviet aesthetics. Some like monumental Brutalist architecture, the uniforms of Komsomol members, and Soviet automobiles. Even the drab Soviet panel buildings have their fans, who affectionately refer to them as <em>“panelki.”</em></p><p>Images of the <em>“Soviet future”</em> remain particularly appealing; mosaics depicting cosmonauts and posters showcasing proud workers and soldiers continue to inspire people.&nbsp;</p><p>However, daily life during the communist era is generally viewed as outdated. Soviet interiors are often criticized for their clunky design, commonly dubbed <em>“grandma’s renovation.”</em></p><p>Items from everyday life in the USSR only interest collectors and museums. However, there is one notable exception: Christmas tree ornaments. They aren’t just appreciated by the young and old alike – they have become a real trend.&nbsp;</p><p>This year alone, demand for such ornaments surged 80%. Prices for rare sets and even individual ornaments can reach up to 1.5 million rubles ($19,000). Not only antique dealers but also fashionistas proudly showcase their vintage Christmas ornaments.&nbsp;</p><p>And it’s not just a matter of nostalgia.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fashion, money, family</h2><p>Vintage and retro trends are taking hold across Russia. While Soviet-era clothes, furniture, and appliances may not appeal to everyone, Christmas ornaments offer a taste of history without any discomfort. These aren’t modern copies, they are tangible pieces of the past that can be appreciated and used as intended.</p><p>The growing popularity of Soviet ornaments is also driven by their scarcity. The supply is limited: many ornaments have long been broken, while others lie forgotten in dusty boxes in attics and basements. The original production was never mass-scale, and a significant number of these ornaments were handcrafted, making them truly unique. Experts already recognize Soviet Christmas ornaments as valuable antiques.</p><p>Additionally, there has been a shift in attitudes toward the Soviet past. After the collapse of the USSR, discussions of life under communism – whether in film, media, or literature – became highly politicized. Some idealized this era, while others portrayed it as a dystopia. Debates grew heated, even among those who simply appreciated Soviet aesthetics.&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, even Russians with strong opinions about the USSR became weary of emotional arguments. In recent years, the focus has shifted from glorifying or condemning Soviet citizens to depicting their real lives. Amid all the inconveniences and shortcomings of Soviet life, there’s definitely a certain charm to it.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, these ornaments bridge generational gaps. Not every family has heirlooms that survived the upheavals of the 1990s, but old ornaments can both evoke fond memories for older relatives and delight children.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, Russians have started spending more time with their families. Despite a rise in individualism, there’s a desire to connect more with loved ones. This makes the idea of incorporating vintage ornaments into the family’s New Year celebration even more appealing.</p></div></div>"},{"id":"https://www.rt.com/news/630021-epstein-files-never-closure/","title":"The American people will never get closure on the Epstein files","link":"https://www.rt.com/news/630021-epstein-files-never-closure/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS","hnCommentsUrl":null,"content":"\n                            <p><strong>The Democrats and Republicans initially worked together to release the files, until ‘politics as usual’ inevitably spoiled everything</strong></p>\n            \n                        \n            <p>Across the United States, Democrats and Republicans are demanding that their leaders come clean with the Epstein files and the truth finally be told.

These investment opportunities complemented the ongoing trade cooperation between Russia and the continent. While many previously announced projects had remained on paper, this year, three key initiatives involving the firms saw major developments.</p>\n<p>In July 2025, an intergovernmental agreement between Russia and the Republic of Congo came into effect for the construction of the Pointe-Noire–Lout&eacute;t&eacute;–Maloukou-Tr&eacute;chot oil <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/618675-russia-approves-oil-pipeline-congo/\">pipeline</a>. The agreement is set for a 30-year term, following which it may be automatically extended for another five years. The project will be headed by the Russian company Zakneftegazstroy-Prometey and the Congolese state company SNPC. The parties are now tasked with completing the pipeline design and securing financing.</p>\n<p><em>“Once operational, the pipeline will enhance energy security in the interior regions of the Republic of Congo, including its capital, Brazzaville, as well as border areas with the Democratic Republic of Congo,”</em> said Vsevolod Sviridov, Deputy Director of the Center for African Studies at HSE University.</p>\n<p>Also in July, Mantra Tanzania (a subsidiary of Rosatom) <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/622314-russia-launches-pilot-uranium-processing-project-tanzania/\">launched</a> a pilot uranium processing facility at the Mkuju River project in southern Tanzania. The inauguration was attended by Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan. The facility will test technological methods for uranium processing, and the collected data will be used for the construction of the main processing complex with a capacity of up to 3,000 tons of uranium per year. Construction of this complex, according to Rosatom, is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2026, with operations slated to begin in 2029.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694be8f020302712c735d447.jpg\"  />\n                    <figcaption>\n                \n                <span class = \"copyright\">\n                      ©  Rossotrudnichestvo                                                        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n            </figure>\n\n<p>Another notable advancement is the progress on Rosatom’s El Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant project in Egypt.

This signifies a significant shift from past years, when most meetings, including the Russia-Africa summits, took place in Russia. In November, the Russian agency Rossotrudnichestvo organized a conference in Addis Ababa focused on food sovereignty in African nations. This event brought together officials, representatives from international organizations, business leaders, and academics to discuss the key challenges surrounding food security in Africa and Russia’s role in addressing them.</p>\n<p>On December 20, 2025, Cairo <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/629780-lavrov-meets-african-counterparts-egypt/\">hosted</a> the Second Ministerial Conference of the Russia-Africa Partnership Forum. During this event, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held bilateral talks with over 20 African ministers of foreign affairs.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694bea092030271467499d7c.jpg\"  />\n                    <figcaption>\n                                    Participants attend a plenary session of the 2nd Ministerial Conference of the Russia-Africa Partnership Forum in Cairo, Egypt.\n                \n                <span class = \"copyright\">\n                       © Sputnik  /   Evgeny Biyatov                                                        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n            </figure>\n\n<p>Additionally, several other initiatives occurred across Africa, including Russia-Uganda and Russia-Algeria intergovernmental commissions. A dedicated session on Russia-Africa cooperation also took place during the African Energy Week.</p>\n<p><em>“All of this contributes significantly to shaping the agenda for the upcoming Russia-Africa summit scheduled for 2026, and prepares the Russian side for organizing large-scale events on African soil. In the long term, we can expect Russia-Africa communication to shift to Africa,”</em> Sviridov noted.</p>\n<h2><strong>New ambassadors and embassies</strong></h2>\n<p>In 2025, Russia-Africa relations also strengthened on an institutional level.  In September, Russia appointed an ambassador to Niger; in October and December, Russia appointed ambassadors to South Sudan and Sierra Leone, respectively. The opening of Russian embassies in these countries is planned, and the appointment of ambassadors is a crucial step in this process. In November, the Russian government approved a Foreign Ministry proposal to <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/628719-russia-will-open-first-embassy-comoros/\">establish</a> an embassy in Moroni, the capital of the Union of the Comoros.</p>\n<p>The embassy acts as an <em>“institutional anchor,”</em> transitioning interactions from sporadic contacts to a stable system of ongoing communication channels. Therefore, the appointment of ambassadors and the anticipated establishment of new embassies in several African nations in 2025 represent a move towards long-term collaboration. A notable example is the Comoros – earlier, its citizens had to travel to Madagascar for consular services, including obtaining Russian visas.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694be9a320302712c735d44a.jpg\"  />\n                    <figcaption>\n                                    Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa and Russian President Vladimir Putin shake hands during a meeting ahead of a military parade on Victory Day.\n                \n                <span class = \"copyright\">\n                       © Sputnik  /   Mikhail Metzel                                                        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n            </figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Growth of imports from Africa to Russia</strong></h2>\n<p>Last year set a record for Russia-Africa trade, which reached $27.7 billion. According to Vsevolod Sviridov, <em>“In 2025, a significant increase in trade volume is not expected; it will likely remain within the range of $25–30 billion.”</em></p>\n<p>Preliminary trade data for 2025 indicates that Russian exports to Africa from January to October amounted to $17.6 billion, down 14.4%. However, imports from Africa showed substantial growth, reaching $3.7 billion (an increase of 31.4%). It is likely that by the end of the year, imports from Africa will set a historical record, surpassing the $4 billion mark.</p>\n<p>The rise in imports is due to the establishment of direct trade channels between Russia and African countries, particularly for agricultural products like coffee and fruit. Conversely, the decline in exports highlights the limitations of a <em>“market-driven”</em> trading model, which relies heavily on intermediaries and commodity exchanges. Boosting <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/621222-russia-deeper-trade-ties-africa/\">Russian exports</a> to Africa will require a more dedicated effort from exporters, including investments in supply chains, market research, and workforce development.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694bea7585f54043b518c435.jpg\"  />\n                    <figcaption>\n                                    Tanzanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation Mahmoud Thabit Kombo and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov shake hands as they pose for photos before a meeting on the sidelines of the 2nd Ministerial Conference of the Russia-Africa Partnership Forum in Cairo, Egypt.\n                \n                <span class = \"copyright\">\n                       © Sputnik  /   Evgeny Biyatov                                                        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n            </figure>\n\n<h2><strong>A new generation of diplomats</strong></h2>\n<p>In 2025, a reshuffling took place among diplomats working with Africa. This change was part of the routine cycles and traditions of the Russian diplomatic service – diplomats transition between working in Moscow and foreign embassies. As a result, a new generation of diplomats now oversees relations with Africa, succeeding those who revitalized cooperation in the latter half of the 2010s.</p>\n<p>In August 2024, Anatoly Bashkin, the former Russian ambassador to Cameroon, was appointed director of the Africa department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In February 2025, the ministry introduced a new division, the Department for Partnership with Africa, headed by Tatyana Dovgalenko. This department will focus on enhancing Russia-Africa relations, including organizing summits and addressing pan-African issues. Additionally, in July 2025, Sergey Vershinin was appointed as the new deputy foreign minister overseeing African affairs.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694be95e85f5402c6f1c0e48.jpg\"  />\n                    <figcaption>\n                                    President of Russia Vladimir Putin and foreign leaders at a joint wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Alexander Garden, Moscow.\n                \n                <span class = \"copyright\">\n                       © Sputnik  /   Grigory Sysoev                                                        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n            </figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Engagement within BRICS</strong></h2>\n<p>The crisis facing multilateral platforms became evident this year. Due to several factors, the effectiveness in crafting collective responses to challenges has decreased and affected organizations like the UN, G20, and other regional bodies. In contrast, there has been a notable increase in the popularity of bilateral and regional summits.</p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/thumbnail/6927051685f5403ea20574fe.jpg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/628463-g20-focus-on-african-interests/\">Why the G20 both lost and found its way</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    \n\n<p>BRICS is also experiencing a transformation. Over the past two years, its <em>“African track”</em> has organically complemented Russia-Africa relations – Egypt and Ethiopia joined BRICS in 2023, and Uganda and Nigeria were granted partner status in 2024.</p>\n<p>For now, the expanded organization is adapting to its new configuration and developing a fresh approach, including to its relations with Africa. The focus on Africa has decreased during Brazil’s presidency in 2025, compared to 2023-2024. However, as our expert notes, <em>“In 2026, India will hold the BRICS presidency; India has always prioritized Africa and collaboration with the Global South, so we expect to see more activity in this area.”</em></p>\n<h2><strong>Sahel countries: more than security</strong></h2>\n<p>Cooperation with the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) is growing. A decision was made to establish intergovernmental commissions with these countries. In July 2025, a Russian government delegation led by Energy Minister Sergey Tsivilev visited Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, marking a significant step in boosting trade and economic ties with these nations.</p>\n\n            \n    <p>\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/623175-sahel-russia-tsivilev-visit/\">\n            <span>READ MORE: </span>Not just military instructors: What Moscow is up to in this hot place\n        </a>\n    </p>\n\n    \n\n<p>Additionally, in 2025, an agreement outlining the foundational aspects of relations between Russia and Mali was signed and ratified, setting the stage for collaboration in various fields, including military-political and economic dimensions. The Russian Foreign Ministry plans to conclude similar agreements with Burkina Faso and Niger.</p>\n<p>Russia’s cooperation with the Sahel countries has notably evolved. While maintaining a military component, it has expanded beyond just military instructors.</p>\n<p><em>“Russia has developed a more comprehensive model of interaction with Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, viewing security not just in physical terms, but also developing cooperation in food and energy security, and information security,”</em> says Sviridov.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694be7a12030273ccf426b02.png\"  />\n                    <figcaption>\n                                    Russian Minister of Energy Sergey Tsivilev and Burkina Faso’s interim leader Ibrahim Traore.\n                \n                <span class = \"copyright\">\n                       ©  Telegram / @minenergo_official                                                        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n            </figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Boosting education</strong></h2>\n<p>In 2025, growth in the field of Russia-Africa education cooperation continues, with more than 32,000 African students enrolled in Russian universities (2024 already saw a 6% increase comparing to 2023). This figure represents about 10% of all foreign students in Russia.</p>\n<p>Russia hopes to expand the number of foreign students to 700,000 by 2030, and is turning to scholarships and the promotion of its language through Russian Houses, as well as cultural centers run by the country’s agency for international cooperation (Rossotrudnichestvo).</p>\n\n            \n    <p>\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/616055-tanzania-russia-ussr-students/\">\n            <span>READ MORE: </span>Before they become doctors or space engineers, they learn Russian in Africa\n        </a>\n    </p>\n\n    \n\n<p>This strategic push addresses Africa’s surging demand for high-quality, cost-effective education, particularly in medicine, engineering, IT, and agriculture. Over 1,600 students from 45 African countries are enrolled in agricultural programs. Applications from African nationals for agricultural studies in Russia have grown fivefold between 2020 and 2025. While Egypt and Algeria lead student sources, interest is robust across Tanzania, South Africa, Angola, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso.</p>\n<p>The agency currently works in 22 African nations, with eight official offices – in South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Zambia, Morocco, Republic of the Congo, Tanzania and Tunisia – and 14 Russian Houses run by local partners, including Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, C&ocirc;te d’Ivoire, Madagascar, Mali, Namibia, Niger, Somalia, Sierra Leone, the Central African Republic, Chad, and Equatorial Guinea.</p>\n<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly underscored that education is a priority sector in engagement with African nations. In June, he noted that more than 40 Russian universities have established partnerships with local institutions in South Africa alone, and that around 570 South African students are currently studying at Russian universities.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694beace2030270c6e7245b7.jpg\"  />\n                    <figcaption>\n                                    Students from Cameroon take selfies during a visit to the Damba Braibunling Datsan in Chita, Russia.\n                \n                <span class = \"copyright\">\n                       © Sputnik  /   Evgeny Yepanchintsev                                                        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n            </figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Sports diplomacy</strong></h2>\n<p>Russia-Africa collaboration in sports diplomacy continued this year. The Russian national soccer team played friendly matches against African teams, including a match with Nigeria in Moscow on June 6 (ending in a 1-1 draw) and with Zambia on March 25 (Russia won 5-0). The Nigerian team was one of the strongest opponents Russia has faced since 2021. The match drew over 45,000 spectators at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium.</p>\n<p>Another noteworthy aspect was the <em>“Olympic”</em> initiative: African Olympic organizations, particularly the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA) have consistently supported the inclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes in international competitions.  As a result, the IOC has recommended easing restrictions for youth athletes from Russia and Belarus, particularly concerning the 2026 Youth Olympic Games in Dakar.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694bea9c85f5404470541d47.jpg\"  />\n                    <figcaption>\n                                    Russia's Matvey Kislyak, Zambia's Miguel Chaiwa and Zambia's Dominic Kanda struggle for the ball during the friendly soccer match between Russia and Zambia in Moscow, Russia.\n                \n                <span class = \"copyright\">\n                       © Sputnik  /   Alexander Vilf                                                        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n            </figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Russian art in Africa, African art in Russia</strong></h2>\n<p>In 2025, the cultural dialogue between Russia and Africa deepened. Russians continued to show interest in African heritage and contemporary art. In Moscow, Africa-themed events became an important part of the cultural calendar. The Museum of Oriental Art opened the three-part exhibition <em>“Africa at the Museum of Oriental Art”</em> which included the exhibition <em>“Mami Wata: water spirits south of the Sahara.”</em> At the new ZILART museum, a major exhibition titled <em>“African art: gods, ancestors, life”</em> showcased over 1,000 artifacts.</p>\n<p>Cultural collaboration extended beyond exhibitions. The XVII International Chekhov Theatre Festival in Moscow (May 23 – July 25, 2025) featured productions from South Africa, including the music and dance production MOYA. The Russian Institute of Theatre Arts (GITIS) fostered partnerships with African organizations, while the Moscow Conservatory and the Bamako Conservatory signed a cooperation agreement.</p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/original/694be83985f54053e748a194.png\"  />\n                    <figcaption>\n                                    The exposition of the exhibition 'Africa in the Museum of the East'.\n                \n                <span class = \"copyright\">\n                       ©  Press service of the Museum of Oriental Art                                                        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n            </figure>\n\n<p>Russian art is also slowly gaining traction in Africa.

A multifunctional editorial center for Radio Sputnik opened in Addis Ababa in February. Educational partnerships continued through initiatives like RT Academy, which offers specialized courses for African journalists and bloggers, and Sputnik Pro.</p>\n\n            \n    <p>\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/615830-russian-media-investment-in-africa/\">\n            <span>READ MORE: </span>‘Russia will tell our story’: African experts welcome Moscow’s media outreach\n        </a>\n    </p>\n\n    \n\n<p>Cooperation between RT and the African Union of Broadcasters (AUB) also strengthened.

More than 30 reports were presented on missionary work, catechesis, religious education, and pastoral practices in Africa.</p>\n<p>Social and humanitarian outreach remains an important aspect of the Exarchate’s mission. In 2025, the Russian Orthodox Church continued projects aimed at aiding local communities, including the construction of schools, food assistance, and the provision of humanitarian supplies. Efforts were made to provide access to clean drinking water, particularly in rural areas. For example, the first well-drilling project supported by the African Exarchate was <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/612917-russian-church-launches-clean-water-project/\">launched</a> in the northern regions of Cameroon.</p>\n<p>Similar initiatives have previously been implemented in Tanzania, Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia. These projects are funded through voluntary donations and are carried out in close collaboration with local congregations and communities.</p>\n<h2><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2>\n<p>2025 has been a year of intensive rather than extensive growth in terms of Russia-Africa relations. Russia has shifted from establishing new platforms and forging partnerships to enriching the bilateral agenda and developing sector-specific cooperation. A significant milestone was the series of Russia-Africa events hosted directly on African soil.</p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.10/thumbnail/68de67e020302752600db477.jpg\" alt=\"RT\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/625742-ghana-seeks-closer-ties-with-russia/\">‘I’m a converted guy already’: Lawmakers from Africa find warmth in Siberia</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    \n\n<p>A notable trend is that most initiatives continue to evolve over time, and in areas like healthcare and education, they have materialized into concrete projects. However, Russia is still cautious about engaging in large-scale initiatives, opting instead for various <em>“introductory”</em> activities. Consequently, while political understanding is growing, it has yet to translate into substantial acceleration in trade and economic collaboration.</p>\n<p>At the same time, interpersonal relationships are also blossoming—more Africans are traveling to Russia, and more Russians are visiting Africa, fostering humanitarian ties that complement the political and economic aspects.</p>\n<p>The year 2026 will be crucial for bilateral relations. We anticipate more news regarding Russia-Africa interactions, especially since the third Russia-Africa summit is <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/629817-lavrov-cairo-africa-potential/\">scheduled</a> for next year. The current crisis in <em>“summit diplomacy”</em> and the maturation of Russia-Africa relations signify that it will differ from the summits held in 2023 and 2019.

These investment opportunities complemented the ongoing trade cooperation between Russia and the continent. While many previously announced projects had remained on paper, this year, three key initiatives involving the firms saw major developments.</p><p>In July 2025, an intergovernmental agreement between Russia and the Republic of Congo came into effect for the construction of the Pointe-Noire–Loutété–Maloukou-Tréchot oil <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/618675-russia-approves-oil-pipeline-congo/\">pipeline</a>. The agreement is set for a 30-year term, following which it may be automatically extended for another five years. The project will be headed by the Russian company Zakneftegazstroy-Prometey and the Congolese state company SNPC. The parties are now tasked with completing the pipeline design and securing financing.</p><p><em>“Once operational, the pipeline will enhance energy security in the interior regions of the Republic of Congo, including its capital, Brazzaville, as well as border areas with the Democratic Republic of Congo,”</em> said Vsevolod Sviridov, Deputy Director of the Center for African Studies at HSE University.</p><p>Also in July, Mantra Tanzania (a subsidiary of Rosatom) <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/622314-russia-launches-pilot-uranium-processing-project-tanzania/\">launched</a> a pilot uranium processing facility at the Mkuju River project in southern Tanzania. The inauguration was attended by Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan. The facility will test technological methods for uranium processing, and the collected data will be used for the construction of the main processing complex with a capacity of up to 3,000 tons of uranium per year. Construction of this complex, according to Rosatom, is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2026, with operations slated to begin in 2029.</p><p>Another notable advancement is the progress on Rosatom’s El Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant project in Egypt. This initiative is not classified as an investment project; it’s being financed through a Russian loan and set to be handed over to Egypt upon completion. However, it remains the largest Russian-backed project underway in Africa.</p><p>In November, a ceremonial event marked the installation of the reactor vessel for the first power unit. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/628061-putin-pledges-long-term-backing-egypt-nuclear-power-plant/\">participated</a> in the event via videoconference. This ceremony signified a pivotal phase in the plant’s technological development and construction progress (which began in 2022).</p><h2><strong>Relocation of Russia-Africa events to Africa</strong></h2><p>The year 2025 was marked by a series of Russia-Africa events held on the African continent. This signifies a significant shift from past years, when most meetings, including the Russia-Africa summits, took place in Russia. In November, the Russian agency Rossotrudnichestvo organized a conference in Addis Ababa focused on food sovereignty in African nations. This event brought together officials, representatives from international organizations, business leaders, and academics to discuss the key challenges surrounding food security in Africa and Russia’s role in addressing them.</p><p>On December 20, 2025, Cairo <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/629780-lavrov-meets-african-counterparts-egypt/\">hosted</a> the Second Ministerial Conference of the Russia-Africa Partnership Forum. During this event, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held bilateral talks with over 20 African ministers of foreign affairs.</p><p>Additionally, several other initiatives occurred across Africa, including Russia-Uganda and Russia-Algeria intergovernmental commissions. A dedicated session on Russia-Africa cooperation also took place during the African Energy Week.</p><p><em>“All of this contributes significantly to shaping the agenda for the upcoming Russia-Africa summit scheduled for 2026, and prepares the Russian side for organizing large-scale events on African soil. In the long term, we can expect Russia-Africa communication to shift to Africa,”</em> Sviridov noted.</p><h2><strong>New ambassadors and embassies</strong></h2><p>In 2025, Russia-Africa relations also strengthened on an institutional level.&nbsp; In September, Russia appointed an ambassador to Niger; in October and December, Russia appointed ambassadors to South Sudan and Sierra Leone, respectively. The opening of Russian embassies in these countries is planned, and the appointment of ambassadors is a crucial step in this process. In November, the Russian government approved a Foreign Ministry proposal to <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/628719-russia-will-open-first-embassy-comoros/\">establish</a> an embassy in Moroni, the capital of the Union of the Comoros.</p><p>The embassy acts as an <em>“institutional anchor,”</em> transitioning interactions from sporadic contacts to a stable system of ongoing communication channels. Therefore, the appointment of ambassadors and the anticipated establishment of new embassies in several African nations in 2025 represent a move towards long-term collaboration. A notable example is the Comoros – earlier, its citizens had to travel to Madagascar for consular services, including obtaining Russian visas.</p><h2><strong>Growth of imports from Africa to Russia</strong></h2><p>Last year set a record for Russia-Africa trade, which reached $27.7 billion. According to Vsevolod Sviridov, <em>“In 2025, a significant increase in trade volume is not expected; it will likely remain within the range of $25–30 billion.”</em></p><p>Preliminary trade data for 2025 indicates that Russian exports to Africa from January to October amounted to $17.6 billion, down 14.4%. However, imports from Africa showed substantial growth, reaching $3.7 billion (an increase of 31.4%). It is likely that by the end of the year, imports from Africa will set a historical record, surpassing the $4 billion mark.</p><p>The rise in imports is due to the establishment of direct trade channels between Russia and African countries, particularly for agricultural products like coffee and fruit. Conversely, the decline in exports highlights the limitations of a <em>“market-driven”</em> trading model, which relies heavily on intermediaries and commodity exchanges. Boosting <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/621222-russia-deeper-trade-ties-africa/\">Russian exports</a> to Africa will require a more dedicated effort from exporters, including investments in supply chains, market research, and workforce development.</p><h2><strong>A new generation of diplomats</strong></h2><p>In 2025, a reshuffling took place among diplomats working with Africa. This change was part of the routine cycles and traditions of the Russian diplomatic service – diplomats transition between working in Moscow and foreign embassies. As a result, a new generation of diplomats now oversees relations with Africa, succeeding those who revitalized cooperation in the latter half of the 2010s.</p><p>In August 2024, Anatoly Bashkin, the former Russian ambassador to Cameroon, was appointed director of the Africa department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In February 2025, the ministry introduced a new division, the Department for Partnership with Africa, headed by Tatyana Dovgalenko. This department will focus on enhancing Russia-Africa relations, including organizing summits and addressing pan-African issues. Additionally, in July 2025, Sergey Vershinin was appointed as the new deputy foreign minister overseeing African affairs.</p><h2><strong>Engagement within BRICS</strong></h2><p>The crisis facing multilateral platforms became evident this year. Due to several factors, the effectiveness in crafting collective responses to challenges has decreased and affected organizations like the UN, G20, and other regional bodies. In contrast, there has been a notable increase in the popularity of bilateral and regional summits.</p><div data-has-alias=\"\"> <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/628463-g20-focus-on-african-interests/\" target=\"_blank\"> <picture> <!--[if IE 9]> <video style=\"display: none;\"><![endif]--> <source media=\"(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" data-srcset=\" https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/xxs/6927051685f5403ea20574ff.jpg 560w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/xs/6927051785f5403ea2057500.jpg 640w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/thumbnail/6927051685f5403ea20574fe.jpg 920w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/m/6927051885f5403ea2057501.jpg 1080w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/l/6927051885f5403ea2057502.jpg 1536w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/article/6927051585f5403ea20574fd.jpg 1960w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/xxl/6927051985f5403ea2057503.jpg 2480w \" srcset=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAQAAACRI2S5AAAAEElEQVR42mNkIAAYRxWAAQAG9gAKqv6+AwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\"> <source data-srcset=\" https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/xxs/6927051685f5403ea20574ff.jpg 280w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/xs/6927051785f5403ea2057500.jpg 320w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/thumbnail/6927051685f5403ea20574fe.jpg 460w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/m/6927051885f5403ea2057501.jpg 540w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/l/6927051885f5403ea2057502.jpg 768w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/article/6927051585f5403ea20574fd.jpg 980w, https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/xxl/6927051985f5403ea2057503.jpg 1240w \" srcset=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAQAAACRI2S5AAAAEElEQVR42mNkIAAYRxWAAQAG9gAKqv6+AwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\"> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"Why the G20 both lost and found its way\" data-sizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.11/xxs/6927051685f5403ea20574ff.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 300px; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 6px; margin: 10px 0;\"> </picture> <!-- noscript pattern --> </a> </div> <p>BRICS is also experiencing a transformation. Over the past two years, its <em>“African track”</em> has organically complemented Russia-Africa relations – Egypt and Ethiopia joined BRICS in 2023, and Uganda and Nigeria were granted partner status in 2024.</p><p>For now, the expanded organization is adapting to its new configuration and developing a fresh approach, including to its relations with Africa. The focus on Africa has decreased during Brazil’s presidency in 2025, compared to 2023-2024. However, as our expert notes, <em>“In 2026, India will hold the BRICS presidency; India has always prioritized Africa and collaboration with the Global South, so we expect to see more activity in this area.”</em></p><h2><strong>Sahel countries: more than security</strong></h2><p>Cooperation with the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) is growing. A decision was made to establish intergovernmental commissions with these countries. In July 2025, a Russian government delegation led by Energy Minister Sergey Tsivilev visited Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, marking a significant step in boosting trade and economic ties with these nations.</p><p>Additionally, in 2025, an agreement outlining the foundational aspects of relations between Russia and Mali was signed and ratified, setting the stage for collaboration in various fields, including military-political and economic dimensions. The Russian Foreign Ministry plans to conclude similar agreements with Burkina Faso and Niger.</p><p>Russia’s cooperation with the Sahel countries has notably evolved. While maintaining a military component, it has expanded beyond just military instructors.</p><p><em>“Russia has developed a more comprehensive model of interaction with Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, viewing security not just in physical terms, but also developing cooperation in food and energy security, and information security,”</em> says Sviridov.</p><h2><strong>Boosting education</strong></h2><p>In 2025, growth in the field of Russia-Africa education cooperation continues, with more than 32,000 African students enrolled in Russian universities (2024 already saw a 6% increase comparing to 2023). This figure represents about 10% of all foreign students in Russia.</p><p>Russia hopes to expand the number of foreign students to 700,000 by 2030, and is turning to scholarships and the promotion of its language through Russian Houses, as well as cultural centers run by the country’s agency for international cooperation (Rossotrudnichestvo).</p><p>This strategic push addresses Africa’s surging demand for high-quality, cost-effective education, particularly in medicine, engineering, IT, and agriculture. Over 1,600 students from 45 African countries are enrolled in agricultural programs. Applications from African nationals for agricultural studies in Russia have grown fivefold between 2020 and 2025. While Egypt and Algeria lead student sources, interest is robust across Tanzania, South Africa, Angola, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso.</p><p>The agency currently works in 22 African nations, with eight official offices – in South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Zambia, Morocco, Republic of the Congo, Tanzania and Tunisia – and 14 Russian Houses run by local partners, including Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire, Madagascar, Mali, Namibia, Niger, Somalia, Sierra Leone, the Central African Republic, Chad, and Equatorial Guinea.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly underscored that education is a priority sector in engagement with African nations. In June, he noted that more than 40 Russian universities have established partnerships with local institutions in South Africa alone, and that around 570 South African students are currently studying at Russian universities.</p><h2><strong>Sports diplomacy</strong></h2><p>Russia-Africa collaboration in sports diplomacy continued this year. The Russian national soccer team played friendly matches against African teams, including a match with Nigeria in Moscow on June 6 (ending in a 1-1 draw) and with Zambia on March 25 (Russia won 5-0). The Nigerian team was one of the strongest opponents Russia has faced since 2021. The match drew over 45,000 spectators at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium.</p><p>Another noteworthy aspect was the <em>“Olympic”</em> initiative: African Olympic organizations, particularly the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA) have consistently supported the inclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes in international competitions.&nbsp; As a result, the IOC has recommended easing restrictions for youth athletes from Russia and Belarus, particularly concerning the 2026 Youth Olympic Games in Dakar.</p><h2><strong>Russian art in Africa, African art in Russia</strong></h2><p>In 2025, the cultural dialogue between Russia and Africa deepened. Russians continued to show interest in African heritage and contemporary art. In Moscow, Africa-themed events became an important part of the cultural calendar. The Museum of Oriental Art opened the three-part exhibition <em>“Africa at the Museum of Oriental Art”</em> which included the exhibition <em>“Mami Wata: water spirits south of the Sahara.”</em> At the new ZILART museum, a major exhibition titled <em>“African art: gods, ancestors, life”</em> showcased over 1,000 artifacts.</p><p>Cultural collaboration extended beyond exhibitions. The XVII International Chekhov Theatre Festival in Moscow (May 23 – July 25, 2025) featured productions from South Africa, including the music and dance production MOYA. The Russian Institute of Theatre Arts (GITIS) fostered partnerships with African organizations, while the Moscow Conservatory and the Bamako Conservatory signed a cooperation agreement.</p><p>Russian art is also slowly gaining traction in Africa. In addition to photography exhibitions, some exhibitions of Russian art took place in Africa; for instance, the reproductions of artworks by Nikolai Roerich were exhibited in Rabat in 2025.</p><p>Another important field is film diplomacy – Russian film festivals took place in the Seychelles and Djibouti in 2025.</p><h2><strong>Media collaboration</strong></h2><p>In 2025, collaboration between Russia and Africa in the media sector intensified. A multifunctional editorial center for Radio Sputnik opened in Addis Ababa in February. Educational partnerships continued through initiatives like RT Academy, which offers specialized courses for African journalists and bloggers, and Sputnik Pro.</p><p>Cooperation between RT and the African Union of Broadcasters (AUB) also strengthened. In November 2025, TASS organized an international press tour titled <em>“TASS–Africa: A Path of Friendship”</em> and announced plans to expand its network of bureaus across various African countries.</p><h2><strong>Healthcare initiatives</strong></h2><p>The healthcare sector became one of the most rapidly evolving areas of Russia-Africa interaction in 2025. The Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor) increased its presence in Africa, sharing its expertise on epidemic response and sanitary oversight.</p><p>In April, <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/616189-russia-launches-first-africa-epidemic-response-drills/\">joint exercises</a> simulating epidemic responses took place in Addis Ababa, focusing on real scenarios of the spread of infectious diseases and improving coordination between African health services and Russian experts.</p><p>A cornerstone of Russia’s medical diplomacy in Africa is the Russian Red Cross Dejazmach Balcha Hospital in Addis Ababa— the first and only Russian multi-disciplinary clinic on the continent, operating since 1947, and a unique symbol of Russian-Ethiopian friendship. In 2025, after a prolonged crisis, discussions regarding the hospital’s future and modernization gained momentum.</p><h2><strong>Church relations </strong></h2><p>This year, a delegation of 30 Orthodox Christian clergy from 22 African countries <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/623854-african-orthodox-complete-visit-russia/\">visited</a> Russia. The visit included a pilgrimage and a conference of the African Exarchate of the Moscow Patriarchate. The group, led by Metropolitan Konstantin of Cairo and North Africa, included clerics from South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Madagascar, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and other nations. Bishop Yevfimiy Lukhovitskiy, a vicar of the Exarchate, also participated in the events.</p><p>The African clergy attended church services presided over by Patriarch Kirill, including an all-night vigil at Christ the Savior Cathedral in Moscow and a joint liturgy at the Holy Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra, one of the key spiritual centers of the Russian Orthodox Church.</p><p>An important part of the visit was the conference of the African Exarchate. More than 30 reports were presented on missionary work, catechesis, religious education, and pastoral practices in Africa.</p><p>Social and humanitarian outreach remains an important aspect of the Exarchate’s mission. In 2025, the Russian Orthodox Church continued projects aimed at aiding local communities, including the construction of schools, food assistance, and the provision of humanitarian supplies. Efforts were made to provide access to clean drinking water, particularly in rural areas. For example, the first well-drilling project supported by the African Exarchate was <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/612917-russian-church-launches-clean-water-project/\">launched</a> in the northern regions of Cameroon.</p><p>Similar initiatives have previously been implemented in Tanzania, Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia. These projects are funded through voluntary donations and are carried out in close collaboration with local congregations and communities.</p><h2><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p>2025 has been a year of intensive rather than extensive growth in terms of Russia-Africa relations. Russia has shifted from establishing new platforms and forging partnerships to enriching the bilateral agenda and developing sector-specific cooperation.

Consequently, while political understanding is growing, it has yet to translate into substantial acceleration in trade and economic collaboration.</p><p>At the same time, interpersonal relationships are also blossoming—more Africans are traveling to Russia, and more Russians are visiting Africa, fostering humanitarian ties that complement the political and economic aspects.</p><p>The year 2026 will be crucial for bilateral relations. We anticipate more news regarding Russia-Africa interactions, especially since the third Russia-Africa summit is <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/629817-lavrov-cairo-africa-potential/\">scheduled</a> for next year. The current crisis in <em>“summit diplomacy”</em> and the maturation of Russia-Africa relations signify that it will differ from the summits held in 2023 and 2019. We can expect more bilateral contacts and the establishment of sector-specific cooperation in areas such as energy, digitalization, food security, healthcare, and education.</p><p>The global landscape is shifting, with the US, China, and the EU reassessing their policies in Africa. Therefore, we may expect adjustments in Russia’s approach as well. As African agency grows, the continent itself will play an increasingly important role in the process, and the effectiveness of dialogue and Russian policy in the region will largely depend on the will and capabilities of the African nations.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/609896-africa-russia-relations-2024-overview/\">Russia-Africa relations&nbsp;in 2024</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/africa/589772-events-russia-africa-relations/\">Russia-Africa relations&nbsp;in 2023</a></p></div><p><em>RT in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://we.hse.ru/en/irs/cas/\">Center for African Studies</a> at the Higher School of Economics (HSE) in Moscow</em></p></div>"}]}
